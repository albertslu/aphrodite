(2) in my off-hours i read, exercise, converse, study, garden, meditate, do arty things, and plan lots of projects that i only sometimes start and almost never finish. (3) i own three chess sets, but don't play chess. (4) in people, i like a precise mix of church giggles and smoldering contemplation; my friends, failing to achieve the impossible, tend to gravitate dramatically toward one extreme or the other. (5) i am deeply offended by bad art, and i'm not sure why. (6) i am not above eating an entire plate of kale and then going to smoke a cigarette. (7) i can yawn without moving my face. (8) i have a contradictory blend of intense compassion and utter self-absorption. (9) i enjoy silence, but not in elevators. (10) i have been a beginning yoga student for 8 years. (11) i can never seem to stand up straight, but when i do: watch out. my height has been described by some as \"gangly\" and others as \"elven\", which to me are two very different things. i have also been told i resemble a \"bundle of sticks.\" (12) my best friend once told me that if i turned out to be a figment of her imagination she wouldn't be surprised, which we agreed was both an enormous compliment and a colossal insult. (13) my pet peeves include people who make noise in movie theaters, a lopsided pasta/sauce ratio, and those who take a really long time in single-occupancy public restrooms even though they know others are waiting because the door handle has jiggled like seven times. also, i think people who feel they're too good to bag their own groceries are disgusting.
