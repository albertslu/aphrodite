(if you like science and expanding your horizons, buy this book!)  i also like the 1954 air force survival manual i bought for 50 cents at a garage sale. i learned as much about the 1950's as how to not die in the woods.  movies: i love movies!  music: i think that every type of music has something to offer, and connects directly to our souls. i've actually got me a scientific theory about that. it involves our our brains' inherent delight in finding patterns, the rhythm of neurons firing, 1-2, 1-2, and the vibratory nature of all matter. six questions asking me about the six things i could never do without. stuff. life. i like to figure things out.  also: oooh! puppies! yes, i am. i once admitted something private on a public website, and by doing so, proved it not to be private. your go-to emotions are excitement and love. you like to do stuff. you're funny, smart, witty, and creative. also, you should rock."

    "about": "single, reluctant professional, likes good food, art, music, surfing and traveling. and anything outdoors really. and sports.  i'm pretty laid back, i think. people have told me that i seem calm, serene. i think that's accurate. but i am a virgo. and i do have some control issues that i'm aware of... that i'm working on ;-)  i appreciate my friends, and spending time with them. the older i get, the more i realize my relationships are what bring me the most joy.  i value intelligence, compassion, mindfulness, creativity, kindness, self exploration, open-mindedness, honesty, pursuit of emotional growth, and spiritual growth. promptness too, i like promptness. and and i'm beginning to think that happiness is a choice.  i'd call myself a homebody. but it seems i'm always being invited to one thing or another, and i tend to say yes a lot. though i feel as comfortable staying in as i do venturing out. and i could be talked into either most times.  i use both sides of my brain equally well. though i've been a heavy on the right side lately. i'm an investment analyst by day, somewhat reluctantly. i'm good at it. but the corporate culture is stifling sometimes. my creative outlets include writing and playing music, for the moment. i think art is essential. a lot of my friends are artists, musicians, or writers. and i am often attracted to women who are creative.  i am a bit of a sports addict. i watch and participate. i am a fan. i do keep up on things, via sportscenter. but i'm not obsessive about any team or sport in particular. i like everything from auto racing to futbol (american soccer). i'll go to an a's game, or a giants game... but i'm starting to feel more sentimental about the giants the longer i live here ;-) i still love to watch the colts play during football season.  oh, and i'm an intj/infj for whatever that's worth. i think the mbti is pretty cool.  and finally, i am looking for a serious, long-term relationship. i moved to sf a few years ago (from indianapolis), ostensibly, to become a writer. but i quickly tired of the poverty. so i'm back to working for the man.  i'm an analyst at an investment firm in the fidi  which i do occasionally enjoy. i suppose you could call it a career, though that word makes me shudder. i don't dislike money, but i've realized it's not going to make me happy. and i don't think most of my co-workers share that sentiment.  i started surfing when i moved to sf too. and that quickly became a new obsession. i've traveled to a few places to surf, nicaragua included. i've been driving down to socal on occasion with friends, to surf and camp. do love the waves and weather down there. not the politics.  i've been trying to pursue other endeavors that might bring me some additional serenity and fulfillment, such as yoga, meditation, and psychotherapy. i do like urban dharma, though i haven't been able to make it lately because of other commitments. and there's a great bikram place around the corner from my apartment, but i tried it ... too hot for me. i think i'm going to try old people yoga next.  i just move into a new place in the richmond too, my first own place in san francisco. i've really been enjoying the solitude, and getting some amazing sleep. and trying to turn it into a home. pretty much anything i put my mind too. i've always been good at sports, and loved them. i grew up skateboarding, so i'm pretty good at that, though i don't do it much anymore. i'm not a bad surfer either.. but i've only been doing it for about 2 years. i wasn't a bad writer, at one time. i got accepted to an mfa program, but didn't follow through. i made it through a pretty tough finance undergrad, and i'm pretty good with numbers and spreadsheets (not something i usually bring up at parties) i'm super resourceful. i've had a ton of jobs since i moved to the city 2 and 1/2 years ago. i did what i had to, on order to get by. i waited tables, did catering, drove a cab (i got lost a lot ;-) ), did construction, and now i'm working in finance again, wearing \"slacks\" to work.  i've been learning to snowboard too, and play a little guitar now and then .. that's coming along... i think my height, most likely. i'm about 6'2\". which doesn't really seem that tall to me, but ... people are always saying to me \"i didn't realize you were so tall!\" something about my height is decieving. i've been told i have a nice butt too. and pretty hands. yes, that's the right adjective. i must admit, i haven't been reading much at all lately... but some of my favorite authors include charles bukowski, salinger, tobias wolff, carver, hemingway. i'm a big fan of the short story. american males too i guess. and the essay. i love the essay. i'm a big fan of denis johnson also, and david foster wallace... i used to be a regular reader of the sun. and i buy the new yorker and the economist sometimes.  music: i listen to a lot of different stuff. i have a habit of finding a song or artist i like, and looping their music in my ipod until i'm sick of it and then never listening to it again. some artists i've been listening to lately include beirut, wolf parade, vampire weekend, phoenix, broken social scene, band of horses, the shout out louds, kid cudi, interpol, local natives. big fan of aimee mann too... and i think the smiths are probably my all time fav band (yes, i'm sensitive, and proud of it). and love me some old school hip-hop, you know, like tribe called quest.  food: i love it all, seriously. indian, thai, vietnamese, japanese, chinese, mexican, burmese, italian.... i'll try anything.. and a good cheeseburger too. i try to eat relatively healthy, but i don't discriminate. i'm from indiana. i've eaten a lot of fried things on sticks. my mother is a gourmet cook and i grew up eating some pretty exotic foods. but i've been thinking about putting an in n out burger between two glazed donuts. you haven't lived, right? my buddy did it.... i respect him.  and, the thing is, i proabably eat at least a few burritos a week. i could probably eat mexican every day.  and, i think, food is probably, in a sense, a deal-breaker for me.. i mean, if you're like a super picky eater or a vegan or vegetarian.. it's probably gonna be a challenge for us to make things work. i really love eating all kinds of food. i totally respect vegetarians, but it ain't my thing right now.  i do eat out a lot. there's so much great food in this city, it's hard not to. most of it is pretty reasonably priced. but i think i should cook more. and i'm trying to make that happen.  as far as movies go, i like stuff that's original, and idiosyncratic. i like a lot of independent films. but i just saw iron man 2 and really liked it, so... music, definitely. makes me happy.  physical excercise. mostly takes the form of surfing these days.  my friends; life would be pretty lonely without them.  good clothes, and cool shoes.. i've been into clarks lately. and i love vans and converse.  coffeeeeeee. yeah i love coffee, the leaded stuff. usually black, maybe a little sugar. martha & bros is probably my fav in the city. blue bottle's a little overrated, but still good. and i've only had philz once. pretty tasty.  a bit of peace and quiet now and then is essential too.  good food. mmmmm. i love to eat. myself. but i'm working on it ;-)  surfing too. and whether a job is just a way to finance your true passion. or if it's supposed to be your passion.  and what comes next. usually pretty wiped out from a full week of work. but i still often make it to dinner and sometimes a movie with friends. saturday night is more my kinda night though. honestly, these days, i like the day more than the night :-)  i used to go to the urban dharma meditation a lot. but i've been busy with another commitment. i'd like to get back to it. i think meditation is a valuable practice. i go to therapy.  and i've got a colorful past, i.e., a lot of life experience. it makes me interesting. you're kind, intelligent, compassionate, and growing emotionally and spiritually. you want something serious, and you realize that long term relationships take work. you're good at communication... or getting better (like me). and you appreciate culture, but you're not a total snob about it. like i mentioned, i've eaten a lot of fried things on sticks. and i'd do it again!  it would help if you like sports ;-) or, you're at least tolerant of them. and you gotta like the outdoors!  and you're not too busy to date either...  oh yeah, and bonus points if you surf. or you want to learn."

    "about": "i think we might only live once and if that's the case, don't want to look back and think i wasted it. therefore, i'll try everything once and would love to find someone who shares that approach. wait. rephrase that, practically anything ... i don't do threesomes. let's just get that out of the way. i've seen one too many raised eyebrows when you say i'll try everything once.  ok, now that i've lost 99% of you, movin' right along...  i'm a bit of a romantic at heart; ok a lot of a romantic. my secret heart hopes against all odds for that elusive eyes meeting, sparks flying, take your breath away moment at starbucks or on muni when my latte goes flying into your lap and... kismet. ok maybe not quite like that. but the realist in me knows that considering the characters i see on muni, the chances of some crazy barking at me the whole way home (sadly not a figure of speech, it's happened) are much higher, so i guess this is my way of stacking the odds.  i'm inquisitive, have the curiosity (and sometimes energy) of a 5 year old, and an often equally ridiculously childish spirit. it's hard to find an event or activity i won't enjoy. arts, culture, sports, nature, trashy tv... all are good by me.  i'd also say i'm pretty centered. i know where i came from and i'd like to think i have a good idea of who i am and what i ultimately want out of life. where? now that's another story. as a friend once described it, i have a bit of an \"itchy feet syndrome\" (and no, not the kind that is cured by a spray - oops, did i cross the line there?). i think it's a great big world out there so why stick to one place.  so no, i'm not someone who sees themselves as a bay area lifer, but you never know.... for the right person, i could be persuaded.  what else? i tend to leap before i look, which can sometimes backfire but more often than not, i would hope is usually a good thing - it's important to take chances, right? east coast girl by upbringing, i lived in london for a couple of years before coming out west. neither were premeditated moves, but wouldn't take either one back if i could. my family is in europe so if you're into the idea of living out there someday, bonus points. but hey, if you give me the chance to pick up right now and move to hong kong, hey.... i could be persuaded to do that too. ultimately, i don't think it's about where you are but who you're with. country mouse or city mouse, there's a little of each in most of us. finding myself. but then again, been doing that for a while. pretty much as long as i can remember.  oh wait, there i am... nope, false alarm. oh lord, the narcissistic category! just kidding.  my job. i'm a recruiter at a tech company and spend about half my life on the phone trying to figure out what makes strangers tick. so yes, i'm a good talker - and try to be a good listener.  i'm a pretty good cook, i have an obscene number of cookbooks and many of them have little tabs for all the recipes i need to try next. i think recipes are a basic guideline, meant to be taken as a starting point and then played with.  i'm a good eater although not sure that's always a good thing. they told me it was when i was five but somehow i think it means different things at that age. working on becoming a better exerciser to off-set that.  filling up my time with tons and tons of useless thoughts and activities.  my mom says i'm a great daughter and my brothers say i'm the best sister they've got (although i am their only one so that does stack the odds in my favor). my dad is a bit quieter then them but i asked and he agrees with mom (not that i put him on the spot of anything). yeah, i have a great family. i did a good job picking them.  and i like to think i'm a good friend. that's for you to find out i guess. my smile and my sense of humor - i usually get told i have great energy which i think it a great compliment. my laugh can be a bit over the top - when i laugh, you know it. and sadly, i crack myself up, a lot.  kids and dogs love me. don't know why - i do have a slight fear of both. but they do. dogs have been known to run across the street and knock me over to lick me. actually so have kids sometimes, minus the licking part. but generally both are cute so it's all good. except for the big ones - dogs i mean. admittedly would be a bit worried if a big kid knocked me over and started licking me. just a bit. books - i go through phases. my favorite book ever is neverwhere by neil gaiman. i tend to really enjoy science fiction. also love novels that really let you get a glimps into another culture. kiterunner, a thousand splendid suns. both absolutely brilliant. and then i revert to the classics. a separate piece. picture of dorian gray. (and once in a while, i will go into more chic lit mode but that tends to be around vacation time. think diary of a london call girl - still not sure how i feel about that one)  tv - i recently dumped my cable. huge huge move for me, especially because i tend to be a bit technologically challenged but i think i'm digging the streaming thing. it's great because i can watch all the shows i wasn't allowed to watch as a kid - and then some. before i dumped cable - how i met your mother, criminal minds ( more then 4 episodes in a row is not advisable), law & order, person of interest (guilty pleasure - millionaire matchmaker). now - i just recently watched the very first episode of knight rider - amazing. face transplant in the 80's. they were way ahead of their times. discovered torchwood, rediscovered highlander. shoot, i may just become a trekkie next.  movies - almost famous, less then zero, when harry met sally, breakfast club, fifth element, breakfast at tiffany's, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, little miss sunshine, made in heaven - never heard of it? don't worry, no one has, but it is my all time favorite movie ever.  music - country all the way, yeah for reals. oops. sometimes, do tend to be trapped in a time warp with the early 80's stuff too, especially the hair bands and some new wave. duran duran and erasure over nkotb. and as much as i will deny this at times, i'll admit to having a weakness for lady gaga and katy perry - but really mostly for working out purposes.  food - anything spicy. indian, thai, ethiopian, morrocon, mexican. sushi. not really into your all american food unless it's 4 in the morning in an all night diner. or brunch, brunch rocks! especially dungeness crab eggs benedict and spicy bloody mary's with a big old coffee press. did i mention i'm a good eater? hence my chronic on-again/off-again relationship with jenny craig's and weight watchers. weekdays i'm on, weekends i'm off :) 1. my family (do they count as \"things\" because technically they are people - and technically they are more than one) 2. my passport 3. books - i used to get in trouble as a kid for reading under the covers with a flashlight 4. sunshine 5. the beach 6. my waterproof mp3 player - it's my favorite toy what am i doing with my life. is it the right thing? is there one right thing? where am i going? how do i get there? how do you figure out the path you are meant to be on? do we all have one or do we just make it up as we go along?  should i join the occupy movement? those guys smoking weed in front of my office building at 2 pm when i am desperatly running late for a meeting.... well let's just say i can see the appeal.  what was i in a past life? do i get to pick in the next one or should i be worrying about that whole karma thing?  what other people think about. what do they think about? what would it be like to be someone else? can you imagine if you have a chance to swap bodies with someone... just for a day?  is it possible to stop thinking? nope, because then you're just thinking about not thinking. go ahead. try it. see? still thinking. i can do that for hours. (yes, i am very easily amused) no such thing. watching reruns of charlie's angels while eating takeout sushi? hitting a ball game and picking a fight with the others team's fans - whoever they might be? chllin' at the pub? glamming it up at a night at the opera? camping out at stonehenge? (yes, i actually did that, but it was the solstice so don't worry i reserve nights at mystical ruins for special occasions).  for the record i think that's a ridiculous question. that's up there with where do you see yourself in 5 years. who really knows? that i'm a country music fan? i thought that was pretty private. it is where i come from. that doesn't exactly earn you brownie points back growing up in long island.  not embarassing enough? i used to do a house share on the jersey shore. and no, you may not call me snookie. ... you're no more then 70% enemy (seriously, how does that percentage work? do i bring a sword for that date? pepper spray?)  ... you enjoy doing it up five star style but can also rough it with the best of them  ... you're comfortable in your own skin, have a clear sense of what you want from life, consider yourself intellectually curious and somewhat ambitious ...  ... but are still able to laugh at yourself...  ... you use proper grammar. why do so many people not understand that \"good\" is an adjective and \"well\" is an adverb? you may be \"good\" but you are doing \"well\". sorry, it's a major pet peeve. one of my top two (the other is when people dress their dogs as humans)  ... you don't own more yoga wear then me. controversial to say in sf but honestly, it's disconcerting if a man's more bendy then me, gives me an inferiority complex... ok, maybe i'm just not secure enough in my femininity to be with a man that is that secure in their masculinity.  ... you eat meat. seriously, it's a dealbreaker for me. i have a friend who feeds her cat vegan catfood and i think that's animal cruelty (i'm no nature expert, but have you ever seen the lion nibble on the grass when he could bite into the big, juicy antelope? nope)  ... you can come up with more to send then a wink or a \"how ya doin'\"? really? let's just... for fun... pretend you read the profile. there's a lot to comment on, really. (let's face it, i have issues - comment away!) i assure you i'll read yours before i reply  - you never have and never will text lol or lmfao. seriously wtfdtm????  ... i haven't totally alienated you by now  ... you're still reading this rather long diatribe, you know what you want and you like what you see  ... you're a great kisser ... hey it's a dating site, you have to put in the gratuitous make out reference."

(\"i can go either way\" should totally be my motto - i should get it tattooed on myself.) i'm actually not really that obsessed about pupusas - i just talked so much about them in my profile because i thought it sounded \"cool.\" you like pupusas."

    "about": "hey there. my name is shaun and i currently living in rancho palos verdes. i like all things geeky and dorky, like flight of the conchords, aqua teen hunger force, and mythbusters. i love watching movies, getting out, and simply finding something new to do every single day. i'm very carefree with my spare time.  i graduated from ucsd with a b.s. psychology degree and love all things relating with the field. at ucsd we were more or less forced to specialize in a certain branch of psychology, yet i chose to go ahead and specialize in the behavioral and clinical branches. down the line i plan on going to graduate school, yet i am not wanting to anytime soon. i figure i've had enough of school for now and really just want to get out and experience life as a working man.  i have traveled a lot in my life, and it is an ambition of mine to find someone who i can travel the world with for the rest of my life. i have so far been to zuerich, venice, rome, dublin, belgium, and the northwestern part of germany. i have recently spent five weeks in tokyo for a studying abroad program over the summer.  other things about me are that i know how to cook, can play the clarinet and piano (although i haven't done much since i was younger,) and i can paint. painting is actually a large part of my life as i took fine art classes for 8 years, and spent a good deal of time painting with oils and drawing with charcoal. i currently don't paint as much as i use to, but it wouldn't be difficult to fully get back into it.  i am this, that, and more i am currently working in clinical trials at cedars-sinai medical center. it's not as much fun as it sounds, i swear! basically i fill out papers for people who have experienced adverse effects of their medication and process it to the fda.  but when i am out of the office, i lounge around the coast here in palos verdes with my two cats: fred and nibbles. holding a conversation, being canny, drawing, loving, and being non-judgmental. i believe it would be the red hair! my favorite book is the catcher in the rye. i read it during a difficult time in my life and i felt i could relate so well to holden. nothing else has come closer to hitting home than this book.  my favorite movies vary in genre. i love a christmas story, terminator, ratatouille, meatballs, superbad, and movies like julie and julia, gattaca, and good will hunting.  my favorite band, hands down, is depeche mode. tears for fears, new order, and erasure are also favorite bands of mine. however, i will listen to anything that has decent lyrics and an excellent beat.  food: i've had the pleasure of trying many wonderful things, and i would say my favorite meal is actually quite simple: slices of brie and watermelon. but i enjoy far too many things to list them all, so here's a selection of what i enjoy:  kimchi, chicken, pizza, rice, pasta, steak, ice cream, fish (halibut, salmon, yellowtail), sushi, and all fruits and vegetables. i will try anything quite honestly. great food, good conversation, exercise, leisure, music, and a purpose. how i'll make my first million. then i think about how i'll make my second. i am usually kicking back with my cats drinking a beer and watching something on tv. i only tend to live it up if i'm seeing someone, but otherwise i enjoy a relaxing start to the end of a demanding week. i can't give away all my candy-making secrets! you want to.  but i am always willing to take the time and respond to every message sent!"

    "about": "i grew up in the bay (5th generation marin!) but just moved to sf last winter after about 6 years in nyc. the transition \"back home\" was/is harder than i thought but i'm really happy to be getting to know this place in a whole new way.  despite having lived in and loved some major cities (madrid and lima, too), i'm beginning to suspect i might be more of a country girl after all. i derive a huge amount of satisfaction from manual labor and homesteading type stuff. i'm a little old-fashioned in certain senses, but am very liberal in my approach to other people and find most of them (truly) fascinating and fun. i value self-sufficiency and whatever the opposite of squeamishness is in both the physical and mental realms. i'm an experience seeker and i've collected many, but am hoping to add a larger dose of stability to the mix now. whatever that means.  jesus, this is boring. okay, how about: lately, i've been thinking about summer fruits, hot rods, japanese embroidery, butchery, bread science, homemade hooch, my dog's haircut, hanging plants, knives, old age, canning, money, new york, livestock, running, boating, swimming, camping, road trips, pastry, etc. that might all change tomorrow, but probably not. i settled in sf sort of accidentally. i had taken an extended hiatus from brooklyn to spend time with my parents while i considered job offers in the uae and on a boat, and it suddenly seemed like this was the place to be instead.  i am a cooking school pastry chef, a restaurant cook and a private chef. lucky for me, it's all intertwined and i don't have to pull 18 hour kitchen shifts anymore. i get to design, write and teach cooking classes, create recipes and cook in a variety of amazing settings and i am very grateful to be where i'm at with my career, though always eager to be doing 'more'. e.g., i'm also helping some friends with a ranch in mendocino get their retail meat thing going. i'm learning how to butcher (and slaughter!).  i have a lot of control over my work schedule so i'm making a serious effort to do more traveling. mostly mentally, so far. help? rediscovering california is way fun and i've got friends spread out all over the place who i love to visit. well, food. and i pick up languages easily and have a dorkily huge love for english vocabulary and all that. food and language are very closely related in my mind.  also: organization, re-messing, embroidering, doodling, macgyvering, playing off frightening ailments, saying exactly what i mean, analyzing, seeing the good, jumping in the deep end, multitasking/getting distracted, growing plants, enabling, aggrandizing, cheering, [verb]ing  i am undeniably really bad at math and things involving numbers that i can't convert in to a picture somehow. i just tried to picture \"math\" in my head and my eyes may have crossed. i'm sure it's that i'm tall. unimaginative louts. or my hair... it changes often.  oh, i have two black script tattoos. the one on my forearm seems to be off putting to certain folks who have specific ideas about femininity or class or whatever else. if you're that sort of folk, i do believe we're too sensitive for each other. but you might not notice that first. lists of names are pretty damn boring, right? i like most of the usual stuff that all you other liberal, coastal, impulsive dilettantes like. besides the cataloging of one's favorite things, apparently.  i do have a notable, nerdy love for scifi and fantasy books, movies and shows. i have a crapload of food-related books, of course, and i will eat anything (non-human) at least once and especially if it has sriracha on it. i'm just beginning to cultivate an appreciation for classical music, and i don't own a tv, though i do have the internet (see?).  if you insist, i can provide you with some names - i'm pretty much only ornery with open-ended, robot-generated inquiries, promise. 1) something to look forward to 2) good food 3) time to think 4) the ocean 5) newness 6) love as much as i love to paraphrase myself, i'll just refer you to the above. i often lose track of which day it is. so... this is awkward. i used to be vegan. i own a mets cap. i'm scared of fish. i might give up a kidney. my natural hair texture is wild curls. i sort of love 'fessing up to 'private' things. you have something to say about something i said. did you know that people send out apb messages like 'hey girl, ur hot, i'm a great guy looking for a real woman, let's go on a date'? i'm paraphrasing, but no lady likes to be treated like female #00345 or whatever.  and you're a nice guy with reasonable communication skills. not rebounding or rebelling against your usual type, please.  other than that, you should just message me. i don't know what to do about getting \"chosen\" and i'm not that scary, anyway. simple!"

    "about": "i'm smart, funny, laid back, and generally good-natured. i work hard to support myself, and i value the same in others. my sense of humor can be pretty sarcastic (i think daniel tosh is hilarious, so that should give you a clue), but i'm really a sweet and kind person. i enjoy doing things like going to see live music around the bay area (especially my friends' bands!), going to santa cruz to the beach (i went to ucsc and love it down there, hope to move back one day), and going to museums/zoos/aquariums/planetariums. i could spend all day in an art museum, which is why i usually go alone, because my friends don't have the patience! my dad is the only person who can tolerate it so far, he and i spent a whole day in the musee d'orsay in paris, amazing. i also fucking love ufc and mma, i have been known to start yelling and getting quite excited during a good fight. occasional bloodlust is totally healthy.  intelligence is important to me, so if you don't know the difference between your and you're, then you're out of your mind. i'm dead serious. i was a course assistant for psych 1 in college and gave out so many ds on papers due to poor spelling and grammar. it's important to be able to express yourself in writing, as evidenced by...this profile!  i drink and smoke pot socially, and i don't do other drugs (but i've experimented, in college and beyond, with stuff like shrooms and acid). apparently being an advocate for marijuana legalization makes me \"more drug friendly\" according to okc...i am into buddhist-type mindfulness and try to live harmoniously with others- so no drama, no yelling, no intense pessimism. i believe in living for the moment and being grateful for all the wonderful things i experience each day. a relationship, in my opinion, is something to enhance my life, not fix it or complete it- being a \"whole\" person is an important quality i look for in others. i am in graduate school working on an ma in counseling psycholgoy and will eventually be a licensed marriage/family therapist.  while i'm pursuing my degree, i am working part-time retail to pay my bills. parallel parking, making people laugh, baking cookies, and listening. i laugh easily and often. and loudly! books: harry potter, the golden compass trilogy, survivor, fight club, invisible monsters, the iliad and odyssey, the giver, a thousand splendid suns, things fall apart, any david sedaris.  movies: little miss sunshine, orgazmo!, superbad, any broken lizard film, the princess bride, the addams family, requiem for a dream, snatch, vanilla sky, never let me go, pig (indie film, check it out!!), the notebook (when i want to have a good cry), high fidelity, say anything, 300, leon the professional, and i admit it- the notebook makes me weep.  shows: it's always sunny in philadelphia, tosh.0, the office, how i met your mother, friends, party down, arrested development, law and order, bones, cops, dexter, wilfred, the sopranos, american dad, modern family, community, restaurant: impossible.  music: led zeppelin is one of my favorite things in the world. other than that (and floyd, hendrix, clapton), i like a lot of stuff, from rap/hip hop and the radio to independent experimental music to classical and jazz...i am digging florence + the machine right now pretty hard. i am not too fond of country, but otherwise i like a lot of music.  food: i like to cook, but when i go out i like mexican, japanese, chinese, italian- and i am open to new cuisines and culinary ventures. a cat (preferably my cat), a toothbrush, my glasses, my vibrator(!), my car, and my health. existentialism, mindfulness, the multiverse... at a small local music show, or grabbing a drink with friends. occasionally i will be in pajamas watching tv with cats! i don't like to define my sexuality as straight because i like girls too- physically. i have never met a girl i would date...i just like the pussy sometimes. (sorry if my...forwardness is a little...uncouth...i talk like a man when it comes to sex.)  i have been called a freak on more than one occasion and by more than one person...what can i say, sex is the best and you should enjoy it to the fullest! you find something in my profile interesting.  and to be clear, i am trying to meet new people who are cool and fun to hang out with- i am not looking for love or anything serious right now. although, i am also completely open to letting things happen naturally; i never say never."

    "about": "if not now, when?  i'll admit i am not fond of the dating scene now-a-days. post or answer an ad or profile, exchange a few emails, talk on the phone and a date or two to find out if the pictures are current and who we really are. decide its not what we are seeking. lather, rinse, repeat. and as much as it's work and sometimes with no pay back, i'll continue because i still think there's time to build a library of shared memories. and too many of mine are scattered around the globe with friends not often seen or ex's of one variety or another.  i have no interest in parallel dating. and while i'll admit that fwb has an attraction for those periods when i find myself alone, i really would prefer my last first date. i've come close in the last few years, but...  an s.o. once said i make everything seem possible. i bring that to the table. i'd like you to do the same. not as important that we share the same interests as the same values, though shared interests are great and i have many. i'd love for you to bring new opportunities for things i haven't experienced along as well.  i can be out and active or home with you making dinner and watching a dvd. or practicing \"toe curling\" if we progress to sleeping together. you'll be looking for the hidden bottle of blue pills. they don't exist. i have been fortunate that way and it seems to be appreciated.  i'm early 60's and as everyone seems to say recently, look and act younger. creative, spiritual and bright. liberal. quick witted. dog lover. golf hacker. financially secure but truthfully, have never seen a definition of that overused phrase. i do not do \"long walks on the beach\" as its too crowded with everyone out there that claim they do.  looking for a friend, playmate, lover, partner for movies, live music and festivals, cooking in and dining out, travel and new adventures. a match that can be spontaneous, loves travel and live music with a youthful outlook and energy. i'm likely to see 50 or 60 shows a year and often base travel around shows. think david nelson, furthur, allman's and the like.  you are age appropriate, youthful in outlook and appearance and truly looking for that last ltr. geographic desirability is the bay area. the peninsula makes it so much easier for spontaneous get togethers but i wouldn't want to limit myself geographically and miss a great potential connection. i don't mind driving for that great match, especially if you are willing to do the same  let's see if there is enough spark to meet over a margarita, macchiato or merlot. working hard on two major multi-year projects. thinking seriously about rescuing a dog as its been 7 years and i miss doggy energy around me. playing as hard as i work. and maybe looking for you... most things in technology from being the guy friends call when their computer breaks to designing a home theater.  pool.  being a good friend.  most things i become passionate about.  the company president once told me if he was on \"want to be a millionaire\", i would be his lifeline. ny pizza (or better yet, pepe's) and jewish deli. dim sum. philly cheese steaks. not to exclude finer dining, of course.  old deadhead fond of jam bands including furthur, david nelson, an occasional phish show and quite a bit more. would not miss a who tour.  anything malcolm gladwell writes. never can tell what will grab my attention in books, but usually non-fiction. well there are the obvious things we cannot live without, but this is more what i would choose not to live without:  love, in its many forms family friends dogs music challenges where i want to be on december 21, 2012. concert, movie, home with a dvd. i'd be happy to admit in person. you think we have possibilities. take the risk. i'll reply."

    "about": "born and raised in the midwest, an expat from the beautiful pacific northwest, and settling down in san francisco.  i'm an athletic, ambitious guy who burns it hard by day, but loves getting out for a good microbrew or glass of wine by night.  but as demanding days give way to weeks and months, you've gotta break out. i love to travel. there's not much more fun than flying halfway around the world with someone close and discovering incredible street food while fumbling in broken words and hoping for the best.  it'd be cool to meet folks who are driven, passionate about what they do, and whose excitement and intensity are insuppressible when focused on something they care about. i'm in search of a gentleman and nemesis. i'm pretty active - love going for a good run, bike ride, or swim. i have one triathlon behind me and would love to train for another.  i'm also into homebrewing. i finished a northwest ipa with cascade and amarillo hops this summer and love how it turned out  hoppy, citrusy, a bit floral, and a good punch. i'm torn between making another batch and trying my hand at a spruce pale.  it is hard to say what the next several years of my life will look, but i hope that they involve groundbreaking work in my field punctuated by weekends of camping, racing, and climbing; increasingly challenging international adventures; and meeting some pretty rad new people. pulling off major life changes four at a time. winding up in cities i've never been to and passing for local. reading with suspicion. laying down a voltaire-grade rant. making tapas. pausing to explore the moment as a montage. eating tapas. enjoying a glass of grenache with someone close. gridskipping. helmet head. books: hiding and the moment of complexity (mark c. taylor), the brothers karamazov, the language of new media (lev manovich), blue like jazz, candide, the fountainhead (but not for the philosophy), brave new world, some palahniuk, and about a million books that have to do with programming.  movies: scott pilgrim, magnolia, run lola run, fight club, moon, memento, adaptation, juno, requiem for a dream, waking life, koyaanisqatsi, the life aquatic, city of god, dr. strangelove.  music: zoe keating, ratatat, mogwai, foster the people, fleet foxes, imogen heap, yelle, the xx, sia, david guetta, florence and the machine, deadmau5, digable planets, bt, mysonne, death cab, sufjan stevens, owl city, moby, postal service, snow patrol, lights, mewithoutyou, sigur rs, ani difranco, and massive attack are a few.  food: anything done well. i can cook up a mean paella (photo: http://cl.ly/cuqg), can nail a good tom yum, a passable pho, and am working toward a good ramen. when it comes to drink, i love a good ipa. in wine, i dig a nice syrah / grenache, cabernet, or malbec. in scotch, rye, or whiskey it's laphroaig / lagavulin (smoky as a campfire), willet, or bulleit. there's a microdistillery called house spirits in portland that makes a great gin called aviation. i like to think that i can mix a nice cocktail. it's gotta be:  1. my bike 2. passport 3. running shoes 4. laptop and phone 5. gym membership 6. cascade hops the next beer i'll brew, a new approach to solving a problem that's been on my mind (while possibly enjoying an ipa from the previous batch), or romanticizing about what it might be like to restore a run-down warehouse and make it into something cool. out with friends, having a good time enjoying each other's company (and possibly a manhattan). i dig getting to know people. if you're on the fence about shooting me a message and can't think of anything to say  no worries. find something rad to paste in the box, don't overthink it, and mash that \"send\" button. you do something that you really care about."

    "about": "hello! i'm connie :). i'm currently in completing some training in baltimore for an environmental consulting firm. i'll be back around sometime between august and september...hopefully more august than september.  i've lived in san francisco my entire life, except for the few years i spent in davis.  i would like to say that i'm kind of weird and kind of random, but i think it makes for excellent conversation.  i spend a lot of time baking and cooking, and i'm usually down to try any kind of food. i actually tried baby squid sashimi recently...i don't think i'd ever order it again, but it proves that i'll try almost anything once!  i have concluded my quest for the ultimate chocolate chip cookies (cook's illustrated has a really awesome one), but my search for the best buttermilk biscuit will be put on hold until my training has concluded.  i love being outdoors whenever i can, and yosemite is more or less my favorite place to be. one day i hope to be able to do half dome, but i'll have to work up some courage first. like a lot of people, i love to travel, and some of the places i'd love to visit include egypt, india, papua new guinea, and tibet.  super fun fact: i'm allergic to most sunblocks. this means that some of the ones i do get to use turn me grayish purple. yay! i'm trying to adjust to living on the east coast for the next couple months or so, and i'm trying my best to succeed at training.  heat and humidity are not my friends, but i'm adjusting! baking. i'm especially fond of bread, cookies, and asian sponge cake.  pretending that i'm good at telling stories. i will say, however, that they are sometimes interesting.  making really weird analogies.  organizing stuff. it's really relaxing, i swear!  losing my chapsticks. sometimes they do reappear, though, which means i'm not completely hopeless.  falling asleep, especially during car rides. i'm working on it, though. i like reading fantasy and non-fiction books. some of my favorite fantasy books include the blue sword and the hero and the crown by robin mckinley. i also love hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy, pride and prejudice, anything by carl hiaasen, and the hunger games. most of the non-fiction books are i read revolve around anthropology and nature. guns, germs and steel is definitely one of my favorites.  my favorite movies are hero, my neighbor totoro, stock, lock and two smoking barrels, my fair lady, princess mononoke, fight club, being john malkovich. i recently watched ocean heaven, which is jet li's first full-on drama, and it was depressing and amazing at the same time.  i like a variety of music; i mostly listen to a lot of live 105 and kfog, so anything alternative, but i will occasionally listen to really catchy pop music for the hell of it. my favorite bands include muse, rhcp, the shins, guster, mumford and sons, florence and the machine, sufjan stevens, and the black keys. i will pretty much listen to anything except for country (unless it's the dixie chicks, but that's only because i don't consider them as country). i also love 80s music, even though people think it's weird. you know what, though? 80s music is awesome. chapstick. chapped lips = no fun. water, mainly because i'm always thirsty. internet good conversation hugs mexican food. i'm always down to get tacos, especially lengua tacos. what my job will be like after i leave training. i also wonder if the mosquitoes out here are going to get me (i seem to be safe for now) and whether or not i'll survive my adventures. exploring baltimore with my fellow trainees :) i can't swim, but i will learn someday!  i also hate bananas, but i guess that's not very private. you like cookies, tacos, hiking, 80s music, pugs, and/or hanging out. you should also message me if you're looking to have good conversation, 'cause i'm usually down to talk about anything.  also, you should message me if you're real. that's kind of important."

    "about": "i made my way west to the bay area four years ago via washington dc, southern africa, latin and south america, and southeast asia. i am constantly trying to shake my travel itch. normally, i would easily give into it, and take off somewhere new, but i started a new job in august that i love too much to head anywhere else anytime soon.  in lieu of traveling, i've grown to love california, taking weekend trips to explore new areas as often as possible. things that make me tick: community health care, volunteering, activism, hot yoga, hiking, camping, dance parties, road trips, vegetarian cooking, hot springs, swimming and cute dogs. i am a passionate person who cares deeply about the world and those around me, and value honesty, love, community and good communication. i strive to build and maintain complex and meaningful relationships, and am actively exploring boundaries and possibilities.  i don't conform to traditional definitions of how to live life or navigate through this world. i believe in building deep and intentional relationships and communities; in honoring my commitments to my friends, family and lovers; in fighting the good fight; in challenges norms and assumptions; and understanding and exploring my own privileges and overall systematic oppressions. though i identify as straight, i don't subscribe to heteronormative standards or definitions of sexuality, gender identity, gender roles or relationship models; i'm most comfortable and at home in queer/queer friendly spaces. when i moved to the bay area, i started volunteering at a local free clinic, where i've been a peer counselor and trainer for the past 3 1/2 years. i decided community health was my calling, and now spend my weekdays at a national health care nonprofit in downtown oakland, working with community clinics to improve the quality of care for underserved populations throughout the country.  i've identified as an activist for the majority of my life, though that role has morphed and changed over time. i spend a good amount of my energy trying to make my community, and the world, a more equitable place. but i also really like to have fun, spend time with family and friends, and enjoy being outside, especially when it involves drinking mimosas and laying in the grass on a sunny day.  one of my favorite quotes is : \"i arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world. this makes it hard to plan the day.\" i like this quote because i'm often in the position of feeling like i am choosing between these two priorities as well---do i spend my weekends in the dark basement of the free clinic at an 8 hour training, or say screw it and head to the park, with those mimosas in hand? listening, laughing, loving, hugging, writing letters, cuddling with dogs, being a good friend, clearing out my email inbox, organizing and collaborating, building ikea furniture, moving, and (recently) making terrariums. my oversized sunglasses and side ponytail. -favorite books: most recently it's been octavia butler. also i've jumped on to the hunger games bandwagon.  -favorite movies: amelie and i heart huckabees are two movies i could watch over and over again, but i like most things from dramas to comedies to documentaries. i only movies i really avoid are gory, horror movies.  -favorite shows: i don't watch a lot of tv, but when i do, i like dexter, the walking dead, true blood, american horror story and recently mad men. my all time favorite show was lost.  -favorite music: i like a wide variety of music, but mostly listen to pandora stations featuring pop/folk music. my default station is mason jennings.  -favorite food: i love food, and have been vegetarian for almost 12 years. i normally try to buy organic fresh veggies and fruits; my favorite foods are kale, tofu, quinoa and berries. i don't have a sweet tooth. i could eat thai food every night of the week. 1. animals, especially cute dogs 2. good friends and a strong family 3. swimming/being near water (hotel pools after a few drinks on a work trip currently ranks as a favorite past time; i've made it a goal to explore as many watering holes as possible throughout california over this upcoming summer) 4. activism/volunteering/spending my time working with people on a meaningful and productive community project 5. tofu and other yummy vegetarian food 6. traveling and exploring how i can do my part make this world a more equitable place with less suffering and violence. while at the same time, wondering about what i can do to become a better, more loving person for the people i care most about. and of course, through it all, planning my next adventure. doing a variety of things: cooking dinner/hosting a dinner party with close friends, going out for dinner or drinks, going to art murmur, sleepyfaced from the busy week and taking it easy, dancing, hosting a friend from out of town, or heading out of town to go on a road trip or camping. i like variety, but i am also a planner and like to stay busy and active. i don't really have a sense of smell. the only thing i can smell strongly is mint, and i can't stand it. i'd rather make out with someone who hasn't brushed their teeth in a week than someone who just used mint toothpaste. it's weird, i know. you think we have some important things in common, and would like to chat to get to know each other better or meet up for a drink. i'm looking to connect with people that spend at least some of their time and energy on selfless tasks or projects, want to give of themselves and time to others, and have shared values/ideals around community, meaningful relationships, compassion, genuineness and authenticity. radical, anti-authoritarian or anti-capitalist politics/ethics also make me swoon.  in general though, i'm looking to broaden my community, meet new friends and also to start dating again. i'm pretty open to new people and experiences, but if you marked 'yes' on that annoying survey question about women being obligated to shave, then we probably won't get along for too long."

'cause only sir hammelots truly understands me (this is a joke but still he is great.) 4. my career. it's great to have a livelihood . 5. my hobbies. it's good to have something to do when i am not livelihooding. 6. watermelons. because they are yummy. in addition to all the things i have mentioned in my profile so far i spend a lot of time thinking about philosophy, ethics, theoretical physics and how to meet/date a girl talk about stuff she is interested in which usually has excluded theoretical physics, philosophy and ethics. going out to a dinner or a movie with friends or renting a movie and cooking dinner at home if i'm spending the evening alone. there usually isn't a \"typical\" day. i usually have some thing going on or i have weekend plans that i am getting ready for. this is a silly question. the most private thing i am willing to share with whole of the anonymous population of the world is probably not very private once it has been stated here. :) i would say it's that i have a pair of black and red boxers with lobsters on them. i'd like to think that the connotation is that i am pinchy or that i would like to be pinched or that some one some where is partaking in some sort of pinching proclivities. i would hate to think what else that could mean. that's pretty damn private. err... well it was private until i wrote it here. i probably should not have written any of this. if you want to talk to me. i am very friendly so message away."

    "about": "i'm smart, reflective, aware, funny/sarcastic, authentic, curious, a bit bohemian, and a little irreverent. i am an intellectual, an educator, and a dancer.  i try to see the humor in life rather than get frustrated. i enjoy meaningful discussions about ideas, society, human nature, life, and our own experiences with all of it - of course, interjected with lots of sarcastic comments to keep us laughing. i am a candid and direct communicator and deeply value sincerity and trustworthiness in others.  i am thankful that i have been able to live and travel in various parts of the world (africa, caribbean, central america, middle east, mexico, philippines, france) because my cross-cultural experiences have transformed my worldview and deeply shaped who i am today. i have lived in oakland for four years now, and it is the only place i've been in the u.s. that feels like home, so i'd like to stay. i'm lucky to have found my passion for education and working with adolescents early in life and have continued to find deep satisfaction and success in this field. currently, i'm teaching writing, sociology, and so much more at an amazing small public high school in oakland and loving what i do.  dance has always been a part of my life, but i've studied west african dance for the last 15 years and recently started learning congolese dance. teaching, dancing, analyzing, helping people work through difficult situations, being rationale, making people laugh, knowing what's going on with me and articulating it, speaking up for others, mixing interesting drinks that never taste strong but are, doing nothing when i'm on vacation, being loyal, listening, giving massages, sleeping in, staying calm, recognizing where people could be coming from, naming the elephant in the room. i've been wondering what this question is trying to get at, physical attributes? character traits? regardless, the answer clearly depends on the person and the context...so all those disclaimers aside, all i can say is i often get comments on my earrings, long hair, calm demeanor, confidence, intellect, and genuineness. -music is a huge part of my life. i love to listen and dance to soul, hip hop, & reggae (sizzla, bob, stephen, & damien marley, erykah badu, goapele, amel larrieux, les nubians, mos def, prince, stevie wonder, too many to list). -i often read nonfiction - social justice, history, spirituality (pema chodrun). fiction - david sedaris, paulo coelho. -i do enjoy tv, though i have lived without it easily for years at a time. some favorites have included: the office, 30 rock, house, dexter, chappelle's show, and the daily show. -movies - rushmore, eternal sunshine, pulp fiction, good fences, the spook who sat by the door, lots of social/cultural/historical documentaries -i enjoy great food - cooking it or eating it out, anything spicy and fresh - i'm adventurous. and i am an unapologetic caffeine fiend; i love my coffee. how to be present and make the most of each moment; people - human nature, culture, socialization; issues of equity and justice-in my life and broadly; the young people i work with; and how relationships (broadly defined) are where i continue to find the most meaning and contentment in my life. ... at an extended happy hour with other teachers, out to dinner with a friend, getting work done so i can enjoy the rest of the weekend, or giving myself a break and just relaxing at home to recover from the week. i have never been to vegas or burning man and don't feel like i'm missing anything. you are open-minded, socially and culturally conscious you are self-aware (i.e. self-reflection is a priority for you) you enjoy intellectual conversation, with a healthy dose of sarcasm and ultimately, your purpose in dating is to meet someone with whom you want a life-long, monogamous relationship and to have children."

    "about": "i'll start with the basics, and we can go from there adventurous, i've salsa danced in havana, dove with mantas in the maldives, drank cobra wine in ho chi minh city, explored the favelas of medellin, and swam many times on a full stomach less than 30 minutes after eating. i'm social but introspective; type-a but not sharp-elbowed (i go for what i want, and often get it but never at others' expense); confident yet humble; peaceful but energetic; a believer in doing good while not always being a do-gooder; nurturing yet competitive; and clearly a semi-colon fan. open-minded and playfully sarcastic (native manhattanite, teen years in la), i will make you laugh, either with -- or at -- me. i'm a smartass at times but think that's better than being a dumbass. i'm lucky to have my family and a great core group of friends whom i am close with from as far back as grade school, and they are very important to me. they would likely describe me as loyal, honest, candid and giving. i take a lot of pride in my career and appreciate hard work: i put myself through college and 2 graduate programs (jd, mba). my favorite holiday is halloween and local holiday bay to breakers; in a prior life, i was the dread pirate roberts. i've been a mixture of an old soul and a mischievous kid since i was little -- if i am at a stuffy country club i will try to charge my steak sandwich to the underhills. i've never met a child who didn't like me, but realize i can't please every adult. i love howard stern but will never believe chivalry is dead. lastly, i strive to live according to rumi's four agreements, preferably reflecting on things in board shorts with my toes in the sand and a drink in my hand post-diving, sailing or fishing. living it! working for myself and loving it, keeping a solid balance of work and play, and making sure each day i learn something new. being a good friend and listener. admitting if i'm wrong. trying new things - activities, restaurants, bars, music, etc. taking risks while being true to my core. directions. buying jeans a size small because they stretch. charming hotel front desk and flight check-in attendants into free upgrades. balance. activities i think i am good at include scuba diving; dancing; photography; traveling (especially \"3rd world\" spots, been multiple times to every continent save australia (though did new zealand for 3 weeks) and antarctica); fine wines; dissecting cinema and tv; playing backgammon and poker; talking sports and watching nba live; reading; and laughing. my smile and my eyes usually. books: i read everything, from fiction to non-fiction to cereal boxes. typically a book a week, right now reading keith richards' life and killing pablo. devour both the economist and rolling stone. favorite authors tend to be satire-based (p.j. o'rourke, chuck klosterman, bill simmons, nick hornby, hunter s. thompson, michael lewis). movies: favorite films include jaws; goodfellas; the big lebowski; fletch; the princess bride; vacation; amelie; rounders; fight club; layer cake; boogie nights. sucker for 80s films and zombie flicks too. music: i see live music roughly once a week and listen to everything, but my favorite artists are the beatles; radiohead; phish; massive attack; a tribe called quest; arcade fire; my morning jacket; grateful dead; the smiths; miles davis; and the clash. always looking for the new up and comers, be it djs or indie. soft spot for rush, devo and old hip-hop. tv: pretty much all of hbo/showtime/amc shows (mad men, breaking bad, game of thrones, curb your enthusiasm, homeland, etc.); south park; southland; louie; archer; community; and anthony bourdain's no reservations. food: pretty much all kinds except i'm allergic to shellfish and i don't like large tomato chunks and olives. favorite meal is likely a great ny strip steak or filet au poivre medium rare w/creamed spinach, steamed broccoli and a 2004 or 2005 cab. favorite cuisines include italian; japanese; french; californian; vietnamese; and thai. music. physical activity. my friends and family. sunshine. laughter. oxygen. depends what time of the day it is and what day it is... it is usually a combination of business, pleasure and current events, but often its what do i need to do next to close the deal? how is [insert friend or family member] doing? what music am i seeing this week? where do i want to travel next (dreaming about easter island, australia and kenya)? with apologies to lao-tse, why is it the more i know, the less i understand? what's for lunch/dinner? no friday is typical, i'm up for pretty much anything. likely i am out with friends at a good dinner or seeing live music or a sporting event. i'll save that for the date... can't share everything right away, but i'm very open and up front - i'll answer any question honestly, even if you may not like the answer... you are intelligent, independent, sassy and secure, open-minded, funny and fun... and you are intrigued by what i wrote and want to know more!"

(i love what i do as a career and hobby.) my intellectual side gets off watching a lot of pbs, charlie rose, nova, frontline, meet the press, discovery, science, history, etc etc. entertainment wise i'm in to a lot of different genres, but i have my favorites like: bsg, satriani, torchwood, drwho, kelly's heroes, star trek, hendrix, csi, csn, srv, firefly, jon stewart, george carlin, and every single legendary blues player since 1930 (love that scratchy record sound). if people were included, then my son would be #1 and a significant other as #2, but i'll stick to non living things. 1) music 2) gadgets 3) a car 4) blue skies above a dark green forest 5) a grill 6) and a personal vice love. honestly, i do. so what if its cheesy, or corny, or unbelievable, or contrived, or anything else. i really do spend a lot of time thinking about love. wondering why i didn't buy a gallon of ice cream. won't be private anymore if i display it for the public. i'll need to whisper it to you. any of the above is something you like, but especially if you would like to spend an evening outside with some hot choco, a telescope and a clear sky."

    "about": "i have called san francisco my home for the last twenty years but i have lived also in brazil and mexico for work during that time. i have also lived in france and africa when i was much younger. i enjoy sports very much, mostly windsurfing, kite boarding, paddle surfing, skiing, snowboarding, and sometimes rock climbing and am always open to any new fun activities. i value friendship and feel very lucky to have great friends in my life and live somewhere where i can do many sports, enjoy the outdoors, try great restaurants, and go to interesting events almost anytime. i really enjoy casual clothes and being on a beach here in sf or anywhere in the world but also like dressing up for any good reason. i like to travel and discover new places as often as possible (favorites so far: thailand, morocco, nicaragua, italy, brazil, france, seychelles, egypt, spain, bali, dutch and french caribbean, greece, venezuela, mexico, monaco). on a more serious side, i really enjoy national and international politics, finance, economics, and history. life is very short, so i always try to find the time to enjoy it as much as i can and be straightforward and non-judgmental. i am passionate about the beauty of life, its magical moments and its potential for great happiness. always trying to expose myself to new experiences, new people and the occasional new idea, here at home or somewhere new. enjoying life as often as possible, organizing bbqs for friends at crissy field, deciding what and where to eat, cooking, eating, choosing wine or letting someone else make the choice, dancing, discussing political and economic issues, finding some good in any situation and trying to focus on the bright side of things. you tell me but my guess is my accent - which people know is from somewhere else but most don't know where or get it wrong -- points if you figure it out.... movies - i liked gladiator, french kiss, the last emperor, amelie, apocalypse now, avatar, dirty pretty things, to live, and many others. i also really like historical documentaries. shows - colbert, snl, hardball, meet the press, law and order (old school yes, but i still like it!), jon stewart, oscars/grammys etc.. all types of food and all types of music really, and books, the most recent one i liked was girl with the dragon tattoo, good movie too! friendship and laughing gym early in the am windsurfing, kite surfing, and sunshine good food, wine and champagne nice suits, ties, and shoes, flip flops and board shorts time to travel at least twice a year how short life is and how to be a better friend to the people who are important to me. what new restaurant to try. political events and their consequences, what a nut job gingrich is!!!! hanging at the beach with my friends after windsurfing/kitesurfing and really enjoying it, planning the evening and/or the weekend which usually involves food and wine or beer and other activities or just chilling at home trying a new recipe or watching a good movie. i have a very very big laugh. you're really hot and/or you think you're \"the one.\" you are not a crazy right-winger. you have a good sense of humor. you enjoy going to the movies and trying new places for drinks or food in and around the city. if you like doing sports that's great, but not necessary. it's also great if you're a woman who enjoys both going out with groups of people and spending some quiet time together cooking or watching a movie."

    "about": "i'm a happy person, somewhat of a hedonist who loves to travel and discover new things every day. i think of myself as a perpetual apprentice. i am hyper curious about life, including people. i fully inhabit my body and mind. i love my nieces and nephews, they are my pals! i love my friends for they mean lots to me. i can also be very serious and responsible; i am a leader, and good at it. some tell me that i've got midas hands. i like myself, though i think i can always improve! i have a nice smile. i am warm and affectionate, witty, and a good dancer. and, according to my friends, i mix the best mojitos and margaritas in the bay area!!  and there is a lot more ... but that is for you to find out. i am rethinking my future! does that make sense to you? i am asking myself where i want \"to be\" tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after the day after. in my work, i have the freedom to procrastinate, and i do that at times more than i like to admit. essentially, i am trying to get myself back into writing more often. the problem is that writing must be done in solitude and, being the social being i am, i'd rather be with my friends, telling stories, taking a walk on the beach, cooking dinner, or dancing to salsa, samba or soul(ful) music than sitting at home in solitude, writing. so right now, i'm setting my priorities. and, of course, i think about the things i am not doing enough of, such as dating, making love, romancing, kissing, et. al. so here i am, doing something practical: checking out the profile of all the beautiful women on okcupid (okcupid? the name sucks, don't you think?), and trying to say something that would resemble who i am. being a loyal friend, cooking, telling stories, dancing, loving, making people laugh, keeping babies from crying, engaging an audience, keeping jerks at bay, kissing, being affectionate, speaking portuguese, finding my way without a map, always speaking my heart and mind. my smile, my contagious energy and affection, my lips, and my eyes, so i've been told! books, films, art and music are very much a part of my life. i have many favorite books, but a few in particular i find memorable and so i want to share them with you (and they are available in translation too!): joo ubaldo ribeiro's viva o povo brasileiro (an invincible memory), garcia marquez's del amor y otros demonios (of love and other demons), cristina garcia's dreaming in cuban, jorge amado's dona flor e seus dois maridos (dona flor and her two husbands), & antoine de saint-exupry's le petit prince (the little prince), &, most recently, isabel allende's la isla bajo el mar (the island under the sea), an amazing book!!  i am a cinema lover, so i dig films as disparate as casablanca, lawrence of arabia, king kong, or the artist, as much as no country for old men.  two years ago, i saw avatar, and despite the harsh criticism it received, i really liked it. it's visually amazing, and an astounding critique of empire and of the brazen relationship between corporate interest, science, and the military. it revisits the old question of whether or not it is possible to go native and it comes out with a pretty provocative answer: yes  but.  musically, i can be equally moved by an aria from la traviata as by classic bolero or raggaeton; you name it. i like jazz and as much as ra. indeed, i have an eclectic taste in music, but i draw the line with acid rock, and, frankly, house makes me sleepy.  food (for thought?). yes, i like fresh foods, and when possible eat from the local farmers' market. if eating out, i favor vietnamese, french, spanish, japanese, and, mediterranean food. to be honest, preference aside, i like all foods as long as they are tasty and tastefully prepared. el mar, always the sea the sun, to lift my spirit music, to nurture my soul delicious food, to nurture my senses friends and family, to make me feel at home wherever i am my own soft pillow  no comments! what places i want to visit next; where would i end up living if and when i retire; how to help my family further integrate into their (by-now-not-so) new environment; the current state of my country of birth; the profound relationship between ethics and the economy, and how they impact each other  that famous line from the film cabaret: \"money makes the world go around\" always echoing in the back of my mind; i think about human nature and our capacity to naturalize horror ... and still feel tenderness and love; i think about the future of those i touch with my words and try to convey hope; i think about how human history is the history of social, political, and economic formations and transformations, and that no matter what i think today, life will continue to realign herself, just as it has before us. there is no typical friday night for me. sometimes, like now, i sit in front of my computer, other times, i have dinner with friends, go to a movie, out for a drink in santa cruz, or meet up with friends for happy hours in san francisco, etc., etc. i like to sleep naked, even in the mist of winter, warmed by the touch of worn flannel sheets, of an airy if warm down comforter, and by the skin of the woman laying next to me  though in her absence i have been known to wear flannel pajamas, and socks! you love life, like music and dancing, adore your friends, are a conversationalist  but also know how to walk by the ocean in silence. you should message me if, like me, you like to pamper yourself, are into scents, and into adorning your body (i, for instance, love to wear earrings, and never leave home without my necklace). if you are versatile in body and mind, that is, sexually free, open minded, willing and able to give and to receive love, affection, pleasure, ideas, massages, and more, you should message me. indeed, you should message me if you are a woman with depth, complexity, and a little edge  but not too edgy!  are honest, have integrity, and social consciousness, if you appreciate nature and the outdoors as much as citiscapes, if you enjoy floating in a warm turquoise sea, if you revere the sun, if you love palm trees, if you tresure cultural diversity, and are, or aim to be, worldly. and, definitely, if you think you are attractive, are a fun lover, have a sense of humor, and, most importantly, are able to laugh at yourself, you should message me.  wow that is a lot of ifs, isn't it? ok. i will consider a simpler version of you providing it is the right concoction!!  salut!"

    "about": "i'm an easy going guy with lots of energy, lots of curiosity, likes to ask questions, and doesn't really shy away from stating his opinion -- but also loves to hear everyone else's. i don't beat around the bush, would rather speak frankly, openly, honestly, respectfully. i'm passionate and try to give it all or nothing. i don't half-ass, but also like to sit back, listen and learn. i love to walk the city and take photographs of the street; unnoticed shadows, patterns of natural decay -- to rummage through industrial sites, discover new textures as if i were some sort of spatial forensics expert. i love looking through broken glass, inspecting the city's residual skin up close. there is an ambiguous zone between the grotesque and the sublime that is only a matter of miimeters and perspective that fascinates me -- i'm not into aestheticizing anything, just like blurring the usual frames of our visual logic to subvert the scopic regimes! ha! whatever. i get trapped in bookstores too easily. in fact, i like to take my friends' pubished books at borders and move them downstairs into the new releases section. i'll always meet you somewhere for a cup of coffee (endlessly curious of people's favorite cafes, as if they reveals some deep secrets about them). i'm am a devout walker and public transpo guy, love tromping through the rain, hanging out in the fog, digging the smells of the forest. always on a mission to discover a new vantage over the city. worst part is that i'm a plain old romantic fool who loves coming up with stuff to surprise her - it's all about the smaller clever moves, the lesser obvious gestures of thoughtfulness. after that, i'm just a crazy self-reflective kind of dude looking for someone who also likes to stare at ponds. i can be somewhat of a loner because i enjoy my own time but ultimately believe life is about tangling in the mysteries of collaboration. i'm super playful, love to joke around when i'm not being overly serious -- it's important to be ticklish! i used to be a competetive athlete before i thrashed my body, and am now working on creating and practicing a wise, sustainable and productive lifestyle for myself so i can get stuff done. not that i don't plan to waste time occasionally (i love to indulge wasting time as much as the next person) but i'm more interested these days in trying to exhaust myself of my creative discipline and capacity for productivity. i like to think i do the things i say i'm going to do, especially when other people are involved. reliability is critical in my book. can't stand flakiness. generally, i have a pretty good sense of what i want, but know that is also a trap and won't let it get in the way of meeting a cool woman to hang out with and get to know better.  i am heartfelt, self-mocking, and silly! i'm a writer, mostly architectural journals and pseudo-academic urban geopolitics theory stuff, but have too many other interests i'm tinkering with. was midway through a masters in psychology before i decided to take an extended leave of absence in order to focus more aggresively on the writing, since it's picked up a lot of steam in the last year. i have an unrelated (but somewhat ideal) part-time job i do from home that affords me time to write and pursue other projects. i have been teaching since aug. urban theory and a design studio. and, am hopefully going to be working on some public art projects with compadres in the next year, and traveling more along the us-mexico border for some research.  i'm excited, in a good place, and try to keep it all balanced with taking care of my health, looking after my friends and family, feeding my various passions, and always looking to meet people, explore new shit, and have fun! being respectful, honest, creative, hopeful, understanding, fair, rooting for the underdog, clearly stated, constructively critical, tough loving, forgiving, serious and seriously unserious, resilent, playful, and coming up with ideas. table tennis. remembering your words and what's meaningful to you. strategizing subversive art. spreading my life equally over all the things that are important. checking in on you. surprising you with little detours of fun. mapping things alternatively. being independent. articulating myself, feelings -- i'm a very good communicator, and don't shy away from sharing thoughts only when you are into hearing them. showing appreciation for people. taking responsibility. who knows. my eyes tend to draw some comments. and i can be animated, which usually makes people laugh. not loud or annoying, i don't like to draw attention to myself, i'm just passionate, i guess. i think i also have a reputation for being equally intense as a listener. i like to give my attention with utter this focus this way. this would take hours, so a serious abbreviation:  favorite authors: william vollmann, mike davis, dostoevsky, chekhov, borges, solnit, jg ballard & foster wallace rip...  filmmakers: herzog, kurosawa, aronofsky, s ray, del toro, inarritu, cuarn, chris cunningham  i'm a total documentary junky. love classic cinema, gritty westerns, surreal psychodrama, absurdist black comedy, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred will go with the cheap foreign film over a billion dollar hollywood blockbuster.  music: always trying to expand the ear, evolve my little headspace of musical appreciation. my skull is a heavy conch shell for different music. having been raised by a mother trained on classical and concert piano i'm moved as easily by chopin/satie/debussy/ as i am by autechre/aphex twin/murcof; but, i like to jump around from glenn gould and squarepusher to jorge ben and nina simone, bounce to some jungle, or soak in a brian eno amniotic bubblebath. i like waking up to the smell of fresh roasted coffee and stretching to pearl django, or zakir hussein; color-coding book or music collections to matthew herbert, the orb, whatever -- there is time and place for it all. love jazz, mambo, bossa nova, big band music, percussions of all kinds, music that sounds like a place, a space; massive exoduses of forgotten buildings self-assembled marching to the frontlines of history! not so big on pop. i'm pretty much a sound head, a fiend for the subtleties and textures of the moody soundtrack; sound as it relates to the rest of the picture, sound revealing its own narrative -- audio moments of sexual desire. i lean towards the avant garde; music as shape, languages of noise, new ways of listening, of hearing, combining familiar sounds to make an entirely new atmospheres, acoustic milieus. admittedly, i'm not the biggest ass-shaker on the dance floor. though, would love to learn to salsa. gotta be the sexiest dancing ever! music is more of a run-on narrative there behind my ears like a riverbank, i dig hearing the water, soundscraping signatures of time. it would really suck ass if these things escaped me:  imagination. morning showers. a small pocketable working pen. intimate spaces. random walks & defiant geographies. all of women. making lists and trying and trying to stay productive; article pitches; futurological travel itineraries; the politics and pyschology of space (how people define their spaces as much as they are defined by them); the reflection we find on walls; what the world would sound like if i were to lose my sight; my next blog post; the sex appeal of a great idea; aerobic sex; am i a little crazy?; what do i want to eat?; gaza; music as storage of memory; the fictional appeal in everything; reminding myself to slow down and be patient; the beauty in the peripheral; natural patterns and the antithesis of design; appreciating the unintended; taking care of my body; other people's stories...  i even dedicate time each day to try and think about nothing -- absolutely nothing (just a flame flickering under my breath). relaxing, low key with friends or getting out alone for awhile. maybe catching the sunset from somewhere (a park, the beach, a rooftop); a dinner party, or just looking to try a new restaurant, a bar. checking something new out. or, i might be home writing, reading, chilling with a movie and some wine. whatever. nothing pressing comes to mind here. that will have to be answered more naturally later on. should you feel like it."

(bukowski fan) i'm not a fan of watching ball sports, motocross, or nascar on tv. i sail, ride a motorcycle, mountain bike, snowboard, surf, dine out, movies, ya' know. i used to skate alot but i'm in between insurance carriers. i'm fairly well read, i'm reading 'the grapes of wrath' since it describes my grandmothers basic story so well but i have to admit it's stone cold drudgery. (update: upon finishing it..one of the best literary works of the 20th century) i change my mind sometimes. i've been on a heavy soul music kick lately (sam cooke, otis redding, bobby womack, freddy scott and the four steps, curtis mayfield, moses dillard and the tex town display) i wear a beard in the winter, it just makes sense! icicles form in it when i go ice fishing and it makes me feel like some kind of frontiersman or something. i shave it traditionally on my b-day in march. i'm kind of like my own butler, it sounds better then bachelor. i'm non-denominational but i have a spiritual aptitude that embodies everything living. ultimately, i'm looking for a serious relationship but i'm not going to die trying so i stick to the casual side and let nature do as it will.  i am tough, sweet, and bathing regularly engaging the moment. i'm not bad at anything. i own it, that is, i'm true to myself. i have polemic tendencies and some strong convictions but i feel conversation should lend itself to the pursuit of truth. i'm interested. books: the master and margarita by mikhail bulgokov, the red pony by steinbeck, the old man and the sea by hemingway, tales of the fish patrol and sea wolf by jack london. everything twain, melville and dickens- movies: the harder they come w/ jimmy cliff, brazil, the fisher king, down by law, mystery train (just for screamin' jay hawkins) the dark crystal, the princess bride, the neverending story, public enemy, white heat (cagney fan) the life and times of judge roy bean, the sting, cool hand luke (duh) who's afraid of virginia wolfe, 'a new leaf' and 'mikey and nickey' both by elaine may (i adore her) most woody allen, early peter jackson, everything: hitchcock, coen brothers, stanley kubrick, tim burton, guillermo del toro, wes anderson, elia kazan, akira kurawawa, and my take on cassavetes ...alcoholic (not judging) and genius! all documentaries -music: woody guthrie to bob dylan to tom waits to nick drake to billy bragg, jimmy cliff to carl dawkins, mc5 to the stooges to the new york dolls to david bowie to the x-ray specs to filth to phobia to neurosis to dead and gone, the shirelles to the shangri- las to siouxsie and the banshees, discharge to napalm death, echo and the bunnymen to love and rockets to depeche mode to stone roses to blur to radiohead, the kinks to the 13th floor elevators to the who (early, especially 'sell out'), son house to sonny boy williamson to howlin' wolf to arthur crudup to john lee hooker, fats waller to thelonious monk to chopin to bach, kris kristofferson to willy nelson to hank williams to merle haggard, edith piaf to billie holiday, and everything in between- food: foooooooood! i don't think there's anything i don't like anymore. i made tandori chicken a few weeks ago and it was tadiefo'. cooking is a little like carpentry. my senses and my boots...wait that's 7 things. 8? let's just make it 9 and add sunsets. (sappy) a lobotomy. ok, one thing i should mention is that it's hard to pin me down right now. -*update, i just bought a house and it needs a ton of work. i'm working 12 hour days. if you're awesome, i'll find the time to go out with you though.*- my schedule is all over the place. on a friday night i might not be watching the clock and still in my garage working on a motorcycle or some wood work like a redwood bench for instance. i could also be at a musical event 'losing myself' in torrents of sweat. it's never the same. i'll work 14 hour days for two weeks then take a week off, but i've been trying to work more conventional hours so as to get weekends off for sailing, mountain biking, or going to a museum with a friend. i am very punctual though...i will say that. i'm a native californian yet i'm often accused of having a british accent, (anglophile) i collect antiques (retrophile, we're not going to talk about the marionettes and the cuckoo clocks) and i secretly like oprah (oprahphile) although the viewings are very rare. oh, i have horrible feet and i'm 5' 8\" but 6' in heels. please note* upon reflection, i've met more friends than lovers on this site. -you like and can relate to what you've read. it's certainly not mandatory but it would be nice if you like to play outdoors. i need a backpacking partner! oh, and you don't have a yoga pose in your pics or one wearing a fake mustache. me thinks it' some kind of foppish newfangled mustache cult and it scares me. :) love!"

    "about": "i'm the worst person to write a profile. i'm a hack writer who can't write in my own voice. i don't talk like this, i don't act like this, but i do write like this. you're stuck with me, your unreliable narrator; i'll try to be honest but nobody's who they say they are... and writers are the worst.  writing's not my job, just a hobby. a computer game company writes me checks to program for them. the checks seem to shrink the more i enjoy my job but i'll trade contentment for cash anyday.  either because of my situation or my disposition, i'm laid back about big things with short bursts of intensity about little things. i can spend hours baking and decorating an elaborate birthday cake but spend less time than that thinking about my career. i drive driven people crazy.  which isn't to say i'm a flake or a slacker. towards my relationships, responsibilities and my hobbies, i'm very committed but not very openly passionate. i've played ultimate frisbee for almost half my life, have been programming just as long, and i get up at 7:30 every morning to practice \"ghetto workouts.\" but you won't find any tattooes or bumper stickers pronouncing my love for any of these. for me, a certain level of everyday, low level stick-to-it-ness and consideration says a lot more than flowers.  when i'm with someone, it's all about finding new things in everyday situations, whether it be a different restaurant, a new tv show or a weird play, exploring our own neighborhood, or just creative conversation. talking is the constant in my life: i love talking as an expression of ideas. silly ideas, funny ideas, well expressed ideas, well thought out ideas, weird ideas -- anything that makes the normal world seem a little fresher.  i think accepting random ideas makes me more optimistic. the glass is always three quarters full to me. as a both sides of the street are sunny optimist i can see the good and fun side of everything... except complainers. i hate complainers.  so that's sort of me. take it with a grain of salt. i'm a lot more normal in person... so don't be disappointed. one of my favorite memories is sitting outside on a winter night at a seafood shack in guillord, connecticut, a rare night away from campus, sweeping crab and clam shells into a garbage can in the middle of the table. i don't remember what we talked about, but i remember laughing. and i recall silence as we secretly took swigs from beer cans, cozy in brown paper bags, and wondered whether it would always be like this.  it wouldn't, of course.  life became measured in years rather than semesters. it became an endurance race rather than a sprint. it became mortgages, more hours in the office and quick meals with friends if lucky, alone if not.  everything changed by becoming more the same.  now, i look for my seafood shack moments in every day moments. i find laughter in witty snippets of conversation and in the first words of my nephew. i enjoy the silence of looking at my friends and family, appreciating them for who they were and all they've done, rather than wondering what they'll become. the beer's been replaced with whiskey, but the crab and clams stay the same. i'm good at making boring tasks interesting through anecdotes, stupid bets, and changing the rules. i guess it makes sense since i work in the video game industry, whose motto should be: \"we make waitressing, growing crops, and killing rats fun.\" my dimples! should it be \"dimple\" since i only have it on one side? music: the knife, fever ray, portishead, natalie merchant, neko case, lana del rey, mazzy star.  movies: cremaster cycle, you can count on me, lost in translation, training day, irreversible and the hunt for red october.  tv: mad men, justified, lost girl, gilmore girls, buffy.  comedian: demetri martin.  food: the smoothest, most flavorful ice cream i've ever put in my mouth came from a japanese food club in hong kong. sadly, i don't remember the name, but i do remember the scoops of black sesame and grape (stolen from my brother) melting on my tongue.  radio: npr or a giants game. 1 stick of butter (8 tablespoons) 4 ounces unsweetened chocolate 1  cups sugar  teaspoon salt  cup flour 2 eggs  heat oven to 400. melt butter and chocolate. mix in sugar, salt and flour. mix in one egg at a time. bake for 20-25 minutes in metal pan lined with parchment paper. cool brownies in pan in an ice bath. ...why on earth i enjoy watching mad men. no really, it's a great show, but i have a hard time explaining why. eating at a new restaurant then going home for a movie and a big bowl of homemade truffle popcorn. my social security number is: 587-22-2187. ...you can be unabashedly silly and unabashedly smart. you're nice to wait staff, even if the service is slow."

(if you are a fixie enthusiast thats great and id love to hear about it but im not about to get run down by a muni bus so please don't ask me to join in the adventure). im fairly sarcastic but would hate to be mistaken for unkind, i love to laugh and spend time with my two besties who also happened to move back to the area at the same time. im craving adventure and am truly looking for someone that thinks living in a vw bus while exploring the country and taking photos is a great idea! attempting to live it with no regrets folding t-shirts retail style (a skill i wish i hadn't picked up from years of crappy customer service jobs), having ridiculous overly analytical conversations about social change with my amazing, intelligent friends, making an ass out of myself to cheer you up. my height (or lack thereof) i definitely don't have the patience to type out this ever changing and growing list. so, currently im reading the man who quit money and also a book of john muir adventures. but can always re-read the great gatsby and catcher in the rye. my music is fairly eclectic and im totally open to new things. but if we were on a road trip you would have to be ok with the beatles, and ryan adams. family guy can always put me in a good mood and mad men is my newest obsession (yes i know i'm super late to the party on that one). i'm learning to not be such a picky eater in hopes that it will be one more thing to enjoy about going to new places. im shocked that i love seafood now and never used to, and fresh tomatoes might officially be the best part of summer. 1. the people who just get me... and love me no matter what 2. a camera (of any kind) 3. comfortable shoes (im not that girl who thinks heels are fun) 4. live music 5. coffee dates 6. spontaneity places i want to go and how i can get there. not usually aware its friday. it could be sushi night with friends and dancing after or maybe just a good book and comfy place to curl up at home. i've deleted and rewritten this info several times because im not witty enough to make it sound as interesting as i'd like. you think we might have things to chat about! im definitely down for new friendships and no pressure hang out situations."

    "about": "born and raised in santa barbara, i just moved back to cali after an unbelievable 10 years on the east coast. and although i'll miss the change of seasons and the fast-paced life, it feels really good to be home, where the people are normal (or at least understandably crazy), the politicians are progressive, the vistas are spectacular, the sun is shining most of the time, and snow is something that happens to other people, far far away. very far away.  so even though it's only been a few weeks i've been having a blast reconnecting with old friends, both from home and summer camp. and while i've yet to figure out a way to climb from the dog park back to my apartment without collapsing a lung, my 6-year-old maltipoo doesn't seem to mind the hike a bit (an aside: i happen to have the coolest, most badass, lovable, all-around awesome dog ever. i've even had friends who only thought i was okay, but came around just to play with asta. fair warning).  and before you start thinking i'm one of those crazy pet people, i guess i should say something about myself, which is where i tend to get embarrassed and tongue-tied, but here goes. i'm super outgoing, i talk to strangers all the time, and will for sure get into a van with one if candy is offered. i do fundraising for non-profits (at least i hope to), which is basically planning events to earn money for good causes, which incorporates a lot of my favorite things: people, parties, booze, and saving the world. i'd rather spend time with a friend than alone, but when alone i like to read, explore the city, watch old movies (the 1970s do not count as old), paint (i'm terrible), knit, crochet, or needlepoint (i'm amazing), shop (at least i'm honest), and find other excuses to be outdoors... as long as the weather is nice. i just got my first car ever so i'm trying to plan little day trips or weekend excursions. i'm still navigating the nightlife, and haven't ventured much out of the nob hill area, but it's definitely something i'm looking forward to. baby steps, right?  anyway i guess that's a little bit about me. basically i'm just a girl trying to live life to the fullest, looking for a partner in crime to share life's adventures with. the question is, are you in? helping a friend with his non-profit while looking for a job of my own... sigh... but not with all that much gusto. i'd rather wait a little bit and find a job i love than take the first thing available and be miserable. in the meantime i'm exploring the city, nesting in my apartment, playing with friends, meeting new people, and, clearly, wasting time on okcupid traveling! whether it's home to santa barbara for the weekend or across the pond to france for a getaway, i love love love to travel and will go almost anywhere at the drop of a hat. i want to cruise to alaska and travel down the coast of south america, go back to australia, and explore all of asia by the time i'm 30. there's also this thing called the \"vodka cruise\" that explores the nordic countries and russia... my smile way, way too many to list, but if i had to throw down a few i'd have to say anything mel brooks, anything jane austin, almost anything bruce springsteen, almost anything broadway, and any kind of food you can throw at me except bell peppers (although i'm coming around), oysters, and shaved coconut. (in no particular order...) my dog my computer my kindle my ipod diet, caffeine free soda my bus pass what i can be doing that will make a difference, locally, globally, and for the long run. i really am one of the losers who wants to change the world likely out with friends, boozing and having a few hundred laughs i wish, more than anything, that i could sing. i'm okay, like karaoke okay, but i would make a deal with the devil to be great you like short redheads with sharp wits, big tits, and awesome dogs. (hey, it might not be ladylike but someone had to say it... 5' 4\" is pretty short). and if that didn't make you laugh, maybe you should move on..."

    "about": "i'm 25 years old, living in san francisco. i'm open, outgoing, easy to get along with, funny, and quite the conversationalist. i can have a conversation about the latest episode of conan, or poverty stricken areas in south east asia. but i love to listen as well. its a great way to learn!  i'm witty - but i wear my heart on my sleeve. its pretty easy to tell when i'm upset or exuberant. but that doesn't leave me vulnerable, at least not in my opinion. i know myself well and allow myself to feel. though i think this should make me a romantic, i actually find myself listening to my head more often.  music is my passion - listening, singing, writing or promoting. i support local/indie musicians but am not ashamed to shimmy to mainstream mega-hits either. yes, i said shimmy. i have a background in musical theater and listened to 50-60's music growing up and these 2 genres are my go-to's in the shower.  i love languages, and words in general. i read and i write, i speak 6 different languages and i love to travel and learn about new cultures. i am also really into holocaust/military history.  i love lying at the beach and some water sports but i like swimming in pools better. i suck at the game pool. i like the way mountains and hills dwarf me, its inspirational. i like watching big sporting events. only the big ones though - only watch the superbowl, only the world series, only world cup..i played a bit of volleyball in high school and used to be a competitive bowler.  i've lived in the hills of west virginia and the islands of the philippines. but in my heart, i am a city girl.  i'm also, obviously, a big girl. i'd prefer if you didn't judge me based solely on that. cause that's just one label, and i have a lot.  a few realizations i have made throughout my life: honey makes almost anything taste better. water balloons make almost any situation fun, the british accent makes almost anything sound smart, and having a hookah makes for a great way to mingle at parties. i've had a lot of jobs- corporate, government, business and non profit- but now i'm happy to say i'm enjoying life! i've tapped into my creativity and now work in the music industry! i recently sold an educational musical i worked on for a year and i'm currently managing/ working for 7 local musicians/bands. i love it!  i'm also continuing my love of different languages by learning a 7th language - norwegian. making new friends, telling jokes, singing.. and i'm told i make a mean surf and turf jambalaya my laugh. i'm told its pretty loud. and my super curly hair! and i guess some, less awesome people will notice my weight first! books: night by elie wiesel the alchemist and eleven minutes minutes by paulo coelho the house of the spirits by isabel allende the kite runner by khaled hosseini twenty love poems and a song of despair by gabriel garcia marquez pretty much anything by john grisham and mitch albom  on the lighter side: i love david sedaris and a recent find, \"stuff white people like\" by christian lander  movies: the prestige grumpy old men forrest gump slumdog millionaire love actually hitch the sweetest thing pretty much anything that makes me laugh- tv should be relaxing  shows: currently, the big bang theory, modern family, cougar town  music: i'm a big theater geek. i know a lot of broadway, and off-broadway shows by heart. other than that, adele is one of my idols. i adore this ukelele band called sage and this blues singer named benjamin brown. i love neil sedaka and the everly brothers. but also tinie tempah and raphael saadiq. i love old school rap like tupac shakur and old school snoop dogg and puffy and westside connection. i like the seattle based band barcelona. i wish i could sing like laura izibbor or alicia keys. or even natalie bedingfield. neyo is amazing. and usher. definitely usher.  food: can't have enough sashimi, cupcakes, chai lattes or thai food music. people. pen and paper. a phone-or some other way to contact the outside world. orange juice. sleep mortality. outfits and accesorizing john stamos making perfect mood-oriented playlists on my ipod if i'm not working or at a gig i would either be at a bar for a couple of drinks, maybe at a club... or... watching a movie on my couch with some kettle corn popcorn i'm a bit of a nerd. truly. not in a cute, \"oh she has cute glasses\" way. but in a 'i still memorize the gettysburg address, can list all 50 states and their capitals, all the us presidents and all 27 countries in the eu' way.  i can solve the rubik's cube in under 3 minutes... and i memorized pretty much the entire clueless movie.  a disclaimer: i suck at math. can't do fractions.. or long division to be honest. you are intelligent, open, you like to laugh and have a lot more on your mind than just sex.  do not bother if you are judgemental, violent or have any sort of addiction.  also, please don't message me with ideas on how i could lose weight. the suggestion box is closed for now, but please feel free to file your complaints in the trash can closest to you."

they seem kinda sweet. so, if you maybe felt like it but weren't sure - yes, it's a good idea.  *************************************************  i can no longer ignore the fact that i am definitively middle aged (born 9/10/61), even though it is not at all unreasonable for me to expect (given my genetics & ongoing advances in medicine) that i'll live past 100.  and, y'know, other than physically, i simply don't *feel* middle-aged (let alone old) - and have no intention of doing so any time soon. whatever my calendar says, i insist on keeping the youthfulness in my soul (because, without it, i'm not sure you have one anymore).  and i find myself really wanting more play in my life as time goes on (i see no reason why passing years should diminish my spirit, and i believe play - sexual or otherwise - to be sacred & healing).  - general goofiness - cooking together - kissing for a long while for the sheer joy of it (or because it's leading up to/part of really hot sex - i'm good either way) - friendly sex (friends with benefits - & yes, dammit, that does require actually being friends: sex-only is a fuckbuddy or a booty call [which is also fine, but different], not a friend). - talking late into the night about the nature of love or justice - or just whether the next movie by (fill in favorite star or director here) or book by (fill in favorite writer) or cd by (fill in favorite musical artist) will be a good one - laughing at the world (so we won't cry or throw bombs) - singing together, or singing to, or being sung to by, or reading to you - planning how we'll take over the world - & all sorts of things.  i want new \"special friends,\" and i also want to fall madly (yet appropriately & healthily) in love again.  especially that last. but don't let that scare you off - anything from occasional playmates (the aforementioned fuckbuddy/booty calls), to fwb's, to strong secondary relationships, to potential co-partners are all wanted.  hell, just to avoid confusion (& missed opportunities), let me make it clear that i'm open to entirely nonsexual friendships, too - they're just not the main focus of my being on okc.  it's simply that i'd just feel particularly blessed if, somewhere in all that, some fabulous lady (or decidedly/determinedly unladylike, but technically female, person) & i would find that particular extra spark that takes it from \"wow, you're a cool person to date, care for, & play with\" to that extra-special \"dear gods - i think i could drown in your eyes...\" twitterpation.  pure, occasional playmates - very cool.  good to great friends who also like to play together - even better (just fine w/o the play, too, but again, not my focus here).  people i love/care for, & think of as lovers/girlfriends, but falling somewhere between the previous & following paragraphs - also fabulous.  ass-over-teakettle, goo-goo-eyed, your-chest-hurts-when-you-see-or-think-of-them, bat-shit-crazy in luuuurve - best of all. o;-)  just thought i'd put that out there. in case, y'know, anyone so inclined (to be one of those people, **or to play matchmaker**) might be interested to know it, & maybe even willing to act on it.  my dear wife says that, if anyone has questions (including, but not limited to, whether or not she's really ok with this), you can ask her - she's here on okc as kroberts1969. {{note: as of this writing - 4/18/10 - her okc profile is suspended (though not dead); but you can find her on facebook as kimberly roberts. the kim [as opposed to kimberly] roberts account there was also hers, but got hacked, so she started a new one.}}  in other news, it is sometimes hilarious, always delightful, & might even qualify as reasonably true (that's for others to say), that i have been called both \"culturally queer\" & \"the world's queerest straight guy.\" (i sing show tunes, love to cook, have good color sense, make what they say are better choices than their own on nail polish & lipstick colors for my friends who wear the stuff, get tired of/pissed off at people condemning my love life just because it's not what they're used to, make snarky comments where apropos, etc.).  no reason you should care (unless you have such a reason of your own), just felt like sharing.  that said, however~ the easiest way to learn (even) more about me (if you're not sick of me yet) is to go here: http://www.geocities.com/cynan_poly/index.html  {{as of this writing (4/18/10), geocities is dead, and i need to find another free hosting site for my home page. anyone have suggestions? please bear in mind i am not a comp geek; my skills on this silly box are very limited. but i do still have all the materials/content from the old page.}}  - there, that saves a lot of typing & tells you a lot more than i have patience for re-typing here!  addendum: as for the okcupid matching test itself... due to their insistence on false either/or choices, which in turn seems to spring from their utter failure to take polyamory, swinging, open marriages, or other ethical forms of nonmonogamy into account in formulating their questions and answering options, i have so far gotten both the playboy & the loverboy as results, with equally honest answers - and that's having only taken it twice, while i'm personally sure i could give at least one or two more sets of *also* equally honest, yet different, answers, thereby getting yet other results. the descriptions of both the playboy & loverboy types have a greater-than-random level of truth for me, but both also have big blind spots/false conclusions, based again on those artificially forced either/or answers to what *should* be multiple choice questions, resulting largely, as i said, from their failure to take honest, loving, but open relationships into account. just so you know. ;-)  *************************************************  it may or may not (up to you) be interesting/distressing/delightful to note that, even among my freaky/odd/weird friends, i am sometimes considered just a little strange. *good* strange (mostly), but strange. every time someone thinks they have me pigeon-holed, i do or say something that takes them (& quite possibly myself) totally by surprise.  on another (mostly) unrelated note: i can (& do) see beauty & sexiness in a far wider variety of women than most guys do, even many other non-mainstream guys. and i often find that a woman i didn't think terribly attractive when i first saw or met her, becomes more & more attractive to me as i get to know her better.  that said, however: is it really so wrong of me to hope that, among all the cool women i might find myself attracted to upon meeting & getting to know them, i could also meet some fabulous women whom i find to be really hot *before* i get to know them? - ones who find me attractive, as well (on *either* basis [on sight, or on getting to know me] - i own a mirror & know that women being attracted to my looks alone is, while not impossible, not *the* likeliest thing in the world either)?  relationships where friendship &/or love kindle lust, in that order, are great; but i'd also like some where that sequence is reversed (feel the lust right away, *then* fall in love/become friends with benefits), y'know?  does that make me a bad person?  you know, i just figured - while i'm asking the universe for what i want in life, with no regard for likelihood or even plausibility (like a big lottery win), i thought i might as well throw that in, too.  i am non-monogamous, free thinking, and empathetic trying to make fabulous women laugh, think, or come - preferably any 2 or all 3 at the same time. hoping they'll want to do the same for me (& succeed, with reliable frequency).  trying to find & connect with the sort of women who qualify for the above.  whatever allows me to share the most pleasure, knowledge, fun, & love with the most people.  addendum: okay, you really want to know? well, here's some (more) of it...  i am on staff for 2 sf bay area conventions every year: pantheacon (a pagan-based interfaith gathering modeled on sci-fi cons, held over president's day weekend every february), and baycon (the bay area's major fan-run sci-fi/fantasy con, held over the memorial day weekend every may). i work in the conops room for p-con, and run the info desk for baycon. i love these communities, & several of the others they both tend to overlap with, like the polyamorous, computer/gamer geek, & kink communities.  i'm not sure i should include the rest of this, but i'll see how it goes...  i am on disability, for issues not visible to the naked eye; if you're the sort of person who assumes that any health problem they can't see isn't \"real,\" & the person with the problem must be just a lazy faker - you're either someone who's been badly misinformed (& if you're willing to learn, cool), or a stupid, heartless git; if the latter, please move along now, as i have nothing civilized to say to you, and no interest in anything you might say. invisible disabilities are just as real as missing limbs; if you can't grasp that, move along.  the bad thing about being on disability, aside from the poor health that necessitates it, is poverty (& the limits that poverty puts on your activities); the *good* thing is, i have a very flexible schedule (which doesn't mean i'm not occasionally quite busy).  i sometimes spend a lot of time & effort helping other people deal with their \"stuff.\" i am very good at it, and i ~like~ helping my friends - but i need some relationships that feed me in positive ways, where the other person *wants* me around because they enjoy my company (in whatever way), rather than needing me for support & help. not that i expect anyone to have a problem-free life, or won't be there for them when something comes up; i just want to meet folks whose lives aren't *dominated* by their problems most of the time. also, someone who is open to \"processing\" when it's really necessary - but who would rather *have & enjoy* a relationship than spend all their time *analyzing* it.  this is not in any way a dig at my current friends - quite the opposite: this is me trying to make sure i will have the energy to help them when they need it, by finding additional relationships that are low-stress/high fun-factor.  warning: mini-rant follows! another data point about me (about a *major* pet peeve of mine):  i utterly reject the notion of collective or inherited guilt (as both are forms of guilt by association); if i personally didn't do it, and was in no reasonable position to *stop* it, it was not my fault, and there's no reason i should be made \"the bad guy\" for it.  i further reject the idea that having been a victim of \"x\" (whatever \"x\" might be) makes one an expert on \"x\", or on the solutions to \"x\". nor does it grant one moral superiority over, or the right to harangue & blame, other people. the mere fact that they don't share your particular flavor of victimization, or that they bear a superficial resemblance to those who abused you, neither makes them your enemy nor gives you a right to make demands of them.  any time you pass inflexible negative judgments about someone because they belong to some class that that is based on anything but their own individual actions, that's bigotry - whether you're a klansman claiming all nonwhites are subhuman criminals, a male chauvinist pig claiming women exist only to please & serve men, a rabid fundamentalist proclaiming that all who believe differently than you are devils & deserve to die... or a fat, black lesbian abuse victim blaming all white, straight men (or even all white, straight *people*) for the existence of everything that has ever harmed you in your life.  bigotry is bigotry, prejudice is prejudice, racism & sexism are racism & sexism, *no matter* who it comes from or whom it's directed at - and it's *twice* as ugly coming from those who, having been victims of it themselves, should know better.  two wrongs not only don't make a right - they make a bigger, and ever more self-perpetuating, wrong. an eye for an eye, as they say, leaves the whole world blind.  besides, \"my victimization is worse/more important than yours, & therefore makes me morally superior to you & means you owe me something\" is not exactly either a convincing attitude to take (because it's false) nor a desirable one (because it creates resentment rather than empathy); it's not exactly a good way to win friends & influence people, y'know?  we now return you to your regularly-scheduled search for lovers/friends/people to point at & laugh. being a good friend, singing, cooking, relationship/communication skills, pleasing/pleasuring, thinking, kissing, advising, snuggling, brainstorming, massages, teaching streetfighting skills, fairness, objectivity, pragmatic compassion. reading aloud to my sweetie(-s). seeing the other person's side, even when i really don't want to.  edited to add:  (possibly tmi for some.) i was perusing a pretty lady's profile recently, & she said something interesting: she wanted to hear from guys who not only *thought* they were good in bed, but had been *told* so, by more than one or two women. this was something she really wanted to know, and it occurred to me some other women might also consider that a worthwhile thing to know, so:  i *have* been told that i'm anywhere from very good to extremely good. fairly often & by quite a few partners, actually. they tend to be especially fond of my mouth; my hands; my use of toys; my tendency to actually *listen* when told \"harder,\" \"easier,\" \"faster,\" \"left,\" or whatever; & my willingness to accommodate most requests as best i'm able.  (stipulated: i have some health issues that limit what i'm physically able to do these days, but i am gradually improving in that area. and the mouth/toys/hands stuff is mostly unaffected anyway.)  not bragging - seriously, i'm not. just accurately reporting what i've been told. even after breaking up for other reasons, *exes* have told me this stuff (\"the bedroom was never a problem in our relationship; i never had any complaints there\" is one comment that was recently repeated to me).  put it this way: my wife is a major size queen; most of her sweeties, past & present, are/were somewhere between above average and huge. i, on the other hand, am *not* hung like a porn star (nor like a pencil, either - just not *big*).  yet we've been together since 1997, married since 2002, & she still says i make her come easily, often, & hard. feel free to ask her yourself, if you don't want to take my word for it.  *you* figure it out.  /edit  helping people to appreciate certain movies, books, & good tv shows that they thought they wouldn't like, by helping them see these things from a different perspective, &/or giving them the references they were missing that made the thing confusing to them.  subverting the dominant paradigm where it needs it, and defending it when it actually works (there's that \"objectivity\" thing again). - my size/bear-like build (i am both heavy & quite muscular).  - my eccentricities.  - my blue eyes.  - my voice.  - the contrast between my being bald on top, yet having long hair otherwise.  - that i treat people well.  - that i have (usually well-reasoned, well-informed) strong opinions about many things & am not afraid to use/state them... but am perfectly willing to have my mind changed if there's a good reason to.  - that i am sensitive to real issues, but unwilling to adhere to anyone else's doctrines about them, nor their judgments about how i should think, behave, or express myself; i have no use for *anyone's* \"party line\" as such, on any issue, from the left or the right.  - that i am a sincere, but utterly harmless, d.o.m. (dirty old man). a brief sampling:  books (well, ok, *authors*) - robert heinlein, steven brust, jacqueline carey, george rr martin, jim butcher, neal stephenson, niel gaiman, armistead maupin (if you can read his _tales of the city_ books & not fall in love with san francisco, you have no soul), peter mcwilliams (his _ain't nobody's business if you do_ should be required reading in civics classes, and for anyone thinking about elective or apppointed political office, & can be read for free online);  movies (directors) - tarantino, peter jackson, sam raimi, bryan singer, scorsese, coppola, any fun sci-fi or fantasy; plus, _heathers_ is my idea of a funny comedy, but anything with adam sandler or gross-out jokes is not. stupidity, in itself, does not amuse me; mocking the stupidity of those in power, or other pretentious gits, does. and acid wit is better than slapstick, any day, as clever wisecracks & intelligent sexual innuendo beat fart jokes (with a big, hard stick);  music (artists) - the beach boys to evanescence, the clash to tori amos, the who to coldplay, mozart to sinatra, aaron copeland to mark knopfler, benny goodman to matchbox 20, 40's torch singers to annie lennox, john williams to steve morrissey, cole porter to alannis morissette (distinctly *not* fond of most rap/hip-hop, really hard metal, or industrial - some sounds simply, literally, make my head hurt, and it's hard to enjoy those, though i make no judgment on those who do);  food - almost anything that's of good quality, but neither bitter, nor spicy-hot, nor having a whipped, airy, wet texture. especially love italian, chinese, \"new american,\" any sort of really ripe melon (especially honeydew & watermelon) or stone fruits (peaches, cherries, plums, etc), *actual, good* new york pizza (gods, i miss that!) & italian ices (no, that's not the same as sorbet or shave ice), & i'm a huge carnivore (medium-rare beef & non-fatty duck are faves, but i'm flexible)...  ***please note that i have zero problem with you being a vegetarian or vegan, as long as you have no problem with the fact that i'm not, & never will be, either; i'll even cook vegetarian/vegan food for you (& it'll be good!), once you give me a specific idea of your tastes. but i am a hardwired carnivore/omnivore, and i will not appreciate harsh judgments about that. calm discussion of why *you* are a veggie-person, sure; but not judgmentalism against me for not sharing that decision.***  hold the presses! i have actually found a pizzeria west of new jersey (let alone on the west coast) that makes *good* new york pizza!  (good chicago style is much easier to find. pizzeria uno is all over, and if you want it even better, check out zachary's, if you like deep-dish & haven't tried them yet.)  if you love, or have always wanted to try, real ny pizza, go to one of the locations of the _amici's_ mini-chain. there's one in dublin (we went there), & several more between marin & mountain view in the western part of the bay area. hit them on google, you'll find one.  oh, hell, i could go on & on about my favorite whatever, and i *said* this was only a brief sample - and so it is. yes, really, even though it's this long. by \"could never do without,\" methinks, they most likely mean \"things, *other than* the basic necessities of survival, but which you would be really, really unhappy without.\" on that assumption, then...  in varying order, depending on the mood & the moment:  - healthy, loving relationships of all sorts - from friends, to friends-with-benefits, to (more serious, but not necessarily live-in) lovers, to more spice (\"spice\" being the plural of \"spouse\").  - great, varied sex - ideally with great, varied women, of course.  - books.  - good/great food.  - massages.  - music/singing. the 6 things i couldn't (happily) do without, obviously. ;-)  also, the global & american political situation, how to avoid/reverse the gradually encroaching pluto-theocracy america's becoming (obama: big leap in the correct [not \"right\"!] direction, but _far_ from perfect), why keith olbermann should, but probably can't, be the next president (after obama's done), etc.  how cool it is that, as near as i can determine, the term \"dyke tyke\" (the male inversion of \"fag hag,\" obviously) was invented specifically for me by a lesbian couple (duh) i was platonically in love with circa 1978-'81. if you want to see a 287-lb gorilla cry, ask me to tell you the story some time (but only in person).  never heard the term \"culturally queer\" (like \"culturally jewish,\" but about orientation instead of religion) before it was used to describe me, either, come to think of it. (see \"most private thing...,\" below, for more on this.)  how to meet & get involved with cool, fun, compatible, reasonably sane-ish, bright, local (within 50 miles or so), sexy women (for multiple values of \"sexy,\" *&* multiple values of \"woman\" [so long as it does not currently include a penis] not all of them conventional). ;-)  related/overlapping interests: polyamory, politics, kissing, the space program, polyamorous, sex, intelligent debate, libidinous activities, cuddling, nonmonogamy... watching the sci-fi channel's friday-night lineup on cable (whenever they have a new set of original, or at least new-to-the-us, shows). watching what ever's backed up on the dvr.  now, if you're really asking \"what ~would~ i do on a friday night *with a date*,\" that's another issue entirely - unless she likes the sci-fi channel's friday night lineup (which would be really cool, actually, but not required). and even then, i'd hope we'd add to that curriculum. ;-) hmmm....  nothing's really all that private with me; i know many people say this, but i really *am* an open book. i'll tell just about anyone nearly anything they want to know, as long as it's not a confidence i'm keeping for someone else...  but for the sake of this question, let's say the following:  i love ellipses...  i am a sappy, sentimental person at times - songs or movies can sometimes make me cry, i can't stand to see animals that have been run over on the road, and so on.  i was badly bullied as a child, then got big & strong - i hate bullies. it delights me to make them go \"squish\" - something which, despite my age & health issues, i am still quite capable of, given any legally-acceptable justification.  i tend to be a lot of women's best guy friend - what i need to find are women who find that sexy, rather than those who think it means they *can't* be sexual with you. after all, if you can't do your friends, who are you supposed to have sex with - your *enemies*?!?  mind, this doesn't mean i ~object~ to more female \"just-friends\"-type-people - they're just not what i'm primarily *looking for* on this site. but if i find one (or more), that's cool too!  i have occasionally been called \"culturally queer,\" because i have a lot of stereotypically gay perspectives/attitudes/behaviors on some things, but no sexual interest in guys (this is a variation on the term \"culturally jewish\" - which also applies to me, on my father's side - for people of jewish descent & cultural referents, but who are not members of the jewish religion). lots of glbt friends. see also: \"the world's queerest straight guy.\"  ***i am polyamorous/in an open marriage/sometimes a swinger & attend sex parties. this is vital info for anyone considering meeting me as a potential lover/fwb/what-have-you - go check out www.polyamory.org for more info, if you don't know what the word means.***  my wife has other sweeties, from dear friends to occasional \"pure fun\" playmates, and i hope to be able to say the same. she will be more than happy to tell you this herself - we have no secrets, and nobody is being lied to or cheated on. you can find her here on okc as kroberts1969, if you want to verify this. {{see earlier note - okc profile currently unused, but find her on facebook under kimberly roberts.}}  i am highly sex-positive; i think a lot of our society's problems would be much relieved if we had a more universally approving view of all consensual sexuality, regardless of the number, genders, or kinks of the people involved.  i used to cater the snack table at 2 regular-ish bay area sex parties; sadly, one of them has gone the way of the dodo, while the other is on indefinite hiatus, though they do plan to return. relative to which, i/we are always looking for more \"adult fun\" parties to attend, especially if they take work-trade or have a \"nobody turned away for lack of funds\" policy (we're not cheapskates, we're just *poor*). must be welcoming to all respectful people (little or no size/age/gender/sexual preference/kink limits).  i am mildly/moderately kinky (a submissive-preferent switch, for those who know what that means), but definitely *not* into heavy pain (for myself, that is - if *you* like pain, tell me what you like & i'll do my level best to accommodate you; though i have no sadistic need to do so, i do have a deep desire to make my partners happy, & enjoy doing so). you like giving fruit to the gorillas. especially the smart, human ones.  you have read, are amused by, and are more in agreement than not with the following article on \"poly deal-breakers,\" and other of ipsafictura's writings mentioned/linked to in her \"you should message me if\" section: http://www.okcupid.com/profile/ipsafictura/journal/10171373973536172100/poly-deal-breakers  you understand the wisdom to be derived from _pinky & the brain_, _aunt slappy_, or (more seriously but often with as much humor) keith olbermann's \"special comments\" & \"worst person in the world\" features.  you do not believe that sex, in & of itself & *for its own sake*, is in any way a bad thing, or an unworthy motive in life, nor that someone who openly desires sex is in any way automatically bad (as long as they're reasonably polite) - but you do value sex with love, or at least friendship, as well.  you do not think that differing tastes here & there automatically means that people are sexually or emotionally incompatible.  you understand that age really *is* just a number - otherwise, why would there be so many wise young people, & so many \"adult\" *morons*, in the world? you also consequently understand that an older person desiring or falling in love with a younger one (within the law, of course) is not always, or automatically, \"creepy\" or otherwise bad.  you understand the holiness of fun. seriously. and of chocolate, too.  you are:  - a woman (fsv \"woman\" - anatomically female, at least) who believes, given what i've said above, that we might enjoy each other;  - you're within what *you* consider reasonable traveling distance of alameda, ca and able/willing to come here (or, if you want me to come to you more than occasionally, within an easy transit hop/less than 45-minute drive of me);  - you are an intelligent, open-minded, *decisively* not monogamous, female-type person interested in any relationship ranging from occasional, purely physical playmate to possible co-spouse in a multi-partner relationship with my wife & i, or anything in between (or off to one side).  oh, and (obviously!) if you find the person you \"meet\" by reading this profile &/or my web-page (once i have the latter back up) interesting &/or sexy, of course - that'd be a real good reason to message me! but you knew that."

    "about": "i have an insatiable sweet-tooth, and frequently find myself fantasizing about hot butterscotch souffle, soft-serve ice cream, freshly-baked brownies and real vermont maple syrup. lucky for me, i've also got a pretty speedy metabolism. these days, i guess you could say i feel pretty lucky across the board. i've got a great family, an amazing group of friends, and a job i love in what i consider to be the best, most beautiful city in america.  i grew up in new york city, and its randomness rubbed off on me in what i consider to be the best ways - an ability to communicate openly and honestly without taking myself too seriously, an appreciation for culture and creativity and a passion for the great outdoors (absence makes the heart grow fonder). i moved to san francisco at the end of october, and have been taking full advantage of hikes with breath-taking, stop-you-in-your-tracks views, night (and day) tennis, fresh fish taco stands, getting out on the water with sailor friends, writing in cafes, heated scrabble matches, yoga, chrissy field and presidio sunsets, backyard bbqs, dinner parties, biking across bridges, and enjoying all that lies just beyond the city: sonoma, tahoe, marin, santa cruz, point reyes... if there's a water view where i'm headed- all the better.  what else can i tell you? parents and little kids tend to particularly adore me. on a good day, i'll admit to being quite adorable across the board.....  i'm comfortable in my skin and as a result, tend to meet people quite easily, but i'd love to meet someone who just blows me away. i've heard some online dating stories from friends who have met \"soul mates\"- enough stories at this point to almost make me a believer in computer-generated love.... are you out there?  i am caring, confident, and cookie-craving thinking about what i can do to make the world just a little bit of a better place. learning how to meditate.  career-wise, i work for a brand strategy and innovation firm which basically means that i get paid to invent cool new things and make boring old things better and less boring.  i'm also a writer and just signed my first contract with an agent for a children's book i co-wrote with one of my closest friends. talking to strangers. remembering (and telling) funny stories. planning vacations. brainstorming. co-piloting. making s'mores. encouraging people to take chances. being a loyal friend. guessing numbers. playing well with others. finding things on sale. finger-painting. collecting seashells. my smile and my eyes. where to begin? being an avid writer and reader, i guess i'll start with the books. favorites include: hotel new hampshire, kite runner, atonement, the curious incident of the dog in the night, the brothers k, angela's ashes, sophie's choice, crossing to safety, this side of paradise and pretty much anything by stegner, sedaris, sallinger, irving, fitzgerald, carver, malcolm gladwell or lorie moore.  movie-wise, i usually like it best when it can make me laugh or cry, or ideally, both at the same time. life is beautiful, annie hall, almost famous, little miss sunshine, the big lebowski, shawshank redemption, the hangover, when harry met sally, old school, hands on a hard body.  tv: flight of the conchords and madmen. enough said.  music? these days, it's all over the board...everything from kanye west to david grey, crosby stills nash, vampire weekend, michael jackson, ben harper, miles davis, james taylor, coldplay, u2, citizen cope, adele, ella and louis, and manu chau.  food: japanese, thai, italian, really good cheese-burgers, and of course...desserts. 1. my family 2. my friends 3. being active (ideally outside) 4. travel 5. laughter 6. love where i want to take my next vacation what i'm going to eat for my next meal or snack the sea love unwinding with wine, cooking dinner, checking out a movie...or maybe, meeting you? can't touch this is one of my all-time favorite songs. you're half as curious and passionate about life as i am, and if you've got a big, healthy and (at least relatively) open heart. confidence, kindness, humor and intelligence are definite turn-ons. a close relationship with at least someone in your family is also a big plus."

    "about": "i honestly don't know what to put here anymore. after rough draft after rough draft, i still haven't figured out what sounds right while still trying to be \"catchy\". basically, i'm a warm hearted person (unless you've given me a reason to be otherwise) and i spend most of my time doing art related stuff like painting, drawing or sewing. i'm the kind of girl you can take home to mom and afterwards, break into a playground at night with a bottle of wine, lay on the field and try to figure out where the fuck the big dipper is in the sky. i'm currently working on a clothing line. i'm also a makeup artist and have worked on weddings, proms, model photoshoots and headshots. when i'm not doing any of those things, i work as a nanny. i even have the mary poppins bag of endless goodies to prove it. cooking! i love to cook and bake for my family and friends. i also love to entertain. family nights are a big deal around here. seriously, there's nothing like having epic dance parties in the kitchen. especially when there's cheesecake involved. my red hair and my eyes. combined, is a force that will steal your soul. i also have a few tattoos, and more on the way. but don't worry, it's not like i have rainbow brite riding a bacon unicorn blasted on my back or anything....or do i? books: currently i'm reading pride & prejudice. i'm kind of on a classics kick with books these days. other books that have changed my life- one flew over the cuckoo's nest, a clockwork orange, the great gatsby, the heart is a lonely hunter, being and nothingness, holidays on ice, the ugly stepsister.  music: brand new, gaslight anthem, joy division, siouxsie and the banshees, kitty kallen, rosemary clooney, minor threat, alkaline trio, manchester orchestra, adele...the list goes on forever.  food: i'm partial to the sweet and salty combination. have you ever had a brownie with fluer de sel? well, you should.  television: i love jimmy fallon, how i met your mother, will & grace, true blood, celebrity ghost stories, adventures of the gummi bears, the smurfs, mouse & mole, pee wee's playhouse, bitchin' kitchen, nurse jackie, united states of tara and boardwalk empire.  movies: white christmas, some like it hot, marnie, under the yum yum tree, vertigo, the notebook (don't act like you don't like it too), all of the x-men movies, scott pilgrim vs. the world, the little mermaid. family, friends, ipod, showers, happiness, colgate wisps...no seriously, i'm addicted to those things. -the future and whether i'm making the right decisions or not.  -color combinations  -why people insist on getting spray tans. they all just end up looking like they've been dipped in a bag of cheetos. is that really attractive these days?  -cheesecake flavors. a new recent addition to my cheescake making log is \"blueberry toffee cheesecake\" and \"cinna-roll cheesecake\". (yes, i make the best cheesecake ever. don't question me on this. you will be proved wrong.) most likely spending time with the best friends. we tend to stay up until the wee hours trying to perfect our plan of world domination while picking out nail polish colors. i'm deathly, deathly afraid of raccoons and escalators. anything i've said sounds like something you'd be interested in. if you're looking for a one night stand or a friends with benefits situation, i am not your girl...sorry! all i ask is that you be honest, down to earth and not a serial killer who wants to make a lamp out of my skin...that'd just be a total bummer.  serious dudes only please, and no creepy creepers who creep!"

^_^  the short version: entp, blogger, libertarian and avid cycling enthusiast. for those who care, i'm also a 7w8 on the enneagram sorter.  fans of the ted conferences may be interested to hear that i served as founder/co-curator of the tedx conference in berkeley in 2010 and currently serve as director at tedxsf.  amateur digital photography geek and aspiring humanitarian. former investment-banker and lifetime student of human nature.  most recently worked in investment-management finance, which gave me a box-office seat in observing human nature and its endlessly fascinating foibles and triumphs. close friends have observed me as high-energy and constantly in motion, working either on a variety of business or social-engineering projects.  my blog (started back in 2001, making it one of the oldest continuously-updated blogs online) gives a good first-order sense of who i am.  as a former member of an a capella/chamber singers group, i have an oddball penchant for singing along to catchy songs (i.e. cheesy 80s ballards/pop-rock/chinese-pop music) in my car.  yes, i sing in my car, and i don't care that you see me.  .  .  i am energetic, extroverted, and playful. by trade, i am called to be an advisor, confidante, and consigliere (bonus points if you know what \"consigliere\" means without googling it).  in other words, i am: 1. an angel investor backing promising startups in silicon valley 2. reading too many blogs for my own good. 3. lead-managing one of the largest tedx conferences in the world 4. volunteering with the red cross about 4~8x a month teaching first aid and disaster preparedness from corporate executives to scouts (cub/boy/girl scouts so far) 5. wasting too much time on the internets *cough* *caseinpoint*  by passion - i love stories. stories of redemption, stories of courage under fire, stories of irony, stories that make you laugh until your sides hurt.  on weekends (and some weekdays), you can find my on my bike, riding countless miles through hills and open roads. after recently acquiring a high-powered cycling headlight, i discovered the beauty of nighttime cycling - cold air and the symphony of frogs and crickets trilling their mating songs along the iron horse trail.  social butterfly - at a mixer or conference nearly every week talking with strangers or old colleagues; meaningful, powerful conversations are fuel for my soul.  recent inductee into the cult of crossfit, which means at least twice every week my body is pulverized to a pulp from some grueling workout and training at a muay thai mma gym. the bruises you may occasionally see are from my class, not from a violent lifestyle! :p entertaining a crowd. reading faces/people. buying more nonfiction books than i can possibly read. performing sleight-of-hand magic. poorly.  hosting memorable events.  presence of mind - able to stay focused and positive in hostile/adverse conditions.  making you laugh. high energy, enthusiastic and immodest.  intense, in one-on-one situations, whimsical and extroverted in larger groups.  those who've received letters from me comment on my handwriting - small, precise script which seems at odds with my expansive personality. go figure. books: dune, the mafia manager, freakonomics, the tipping point, sanctuary, the red queen, 48 laws of power, altered carbon, the night manager, the lucifer principle, fight club, book of five rings, the millionaire next door, the game, watchmen, yakuza, ender's game, hot plastic, the last lecture,  lamb: the gospel according to biff, christ's childhood pal  movies: boondock saints, wedding crashers, my sassy girl, jin-roh: the wolf brigade, way of the gun, double indemnity, spartan, the salton sea, 2009: lost memories, jsa, ghost in the shell, new jack city, city by the sea, 500 days of summer, the replacement killers, memento, boiler room, the incredibles, collateral, the sting, tropic thunder  tv: prison break, the wire, burn notice, dexter, arrested development, macguyver, airwolf, house, jericho, dune, children of dune, kingpin, the dragon's den, lie to me, weeds, the shield, sons of anarchy, criminal minds, game of thrones, lipstick jungle, family guy, chappelle's show  music: vienna teng, cheesy 80s pop bands, van halen, andy lau, peter cetera, fort minor, eminem, when in rome, wang chieh capitol steps, alphaville, dire straights, def leppard, poison, alison krauss, chicago, tupac, marty friedman, pet shop boys, richard marx, queensryche, avenue q, erasure, jean-michel jarre, westlife  games: starcraft laptop, cell phone, self-winding watch, cash, a good book. \"hacks\" - how to create shortcuts, improvements on existing channels and ways to shorten paths between objectives.  relationships - why we choose the ties that bind those we leave in the dustbins of our memories.  stories - accumulating compelling stories and finding a way to tell them in the time i've been given. out on a mixer or some tech product-launch party.  movie night?  on a (gasp!) date?  well, up to you on the last one, i guess. :p  so if you've read my profile this far, meet me halfway! who knows what sort of dynamic we can create.  i promise i won't stalk you if you say hi. :) in spite of over 2000 names in my phone (business contacts, alumni association members i chair, attendees of events i host), i still feel alone sometimes.  i have a bad habit of spreading myself too thin socially, and neglect building on my strongest friendships.  a work in progress, as they say. you have a lust for life, a heart for adventure and a happy, well-adjusted outlook on the world.  bonus if you have a healthy relationship with your parents/family.  ps: if you find tim minchin's if i didn't have you the height of hilarity, we'll likely get along famously.  if you found that song offensive ... you're probably better off looking elsewhere."

    "about": "hi!  my name's cameron. cameron, in the gaelic tongue, means crooked nose. all the other baby names in the book are really positive uplifting things, like saul (gift) or david (beloved) or even ananda (the light without which all the world would collapse - seriously.) and i get crooked nose. maybe mom 'n' dad thought i'd be a boxer.  i once got into a knife fight on the streets of belgium. it was the stupidest knife fight ever. myself and an american friend were walking between bars in brussels several beers in, and these moroccan immigrants passing us the other way yelled (in french) - \"hey go fuck yourselves!\" and we yelled back - \" fuck your mom!\" and these dudes wheeled around and ran up to us and got all aggro. i learned that day that some people are just spoiling for a fucking fight, man. i don't get it but i've seen it several times since. anyways after exchanging a few more bon mots this comically short moroccan pulled out this comically small knife and we both stood there , kinda looking equally stunned at each other. i think we both had the same amount of knife fighting experience. he made a halfhearted slash and somehow my lizard brain took over and i caught his wrist, my buddy (a college wrestler) grabbed one of the other dudes, and it could have gotten real bad, except then our other friends who had been finishing drinks at the last bar came up behind us and the aggro dudes suddenly realized it was 5v3 and vanished into the night.  my favorite feeling in the world is when you're walking in a city, and it's sunny outside, and you forgot sunglasses so you're walking along squinting, and then you pass into the shadow of a building. and as soon as you cross that threshold, as you relax your eyes suddenly the whole world slams into perfect focus and clarity. it's how i imagine a zen master must feel when he attains that next level of consciousness.  i've never been accused of being a hipster, but i'm capable of scruffiness.  i'm going to inwardly cringe at any spelling mistakes you make, and if you use a word i'm not familiar with i'll instantly think better of you.  i've gotten pretty big into fitness in the past few months, i've been running about 3 miles a day and lifting 3 days a week. exercise goes in, fitness comes out. you can't explain that.  the transmission got smoked on my last motorcycle, but i'm probably buying a new one soon. riding a bike is up there with the sun and buildings thing, i cannot accelerate on a bike without breaking a huge smile, i don't think it's possible not to.  i love animals - dog and cats of most kinds. i tend to like big dogs more - i'm a big proponent of the thump test for dogs, which states that if i can't violently thump your dog in the side, it's not a good pet. the animal world's about physicality, man. but i make special exception for pugs, because they're adorable. and i love cats too, with the full knowledge that they may scratch the shit out of me with no provocation, if they can catch me. i'm enjoying the fact that we live in the future, as louis c.k. says. this is seriously the best time to be alive ever. 40% of the jobs people do did not exist even 10 years ago (social media expert? really?) . there are so many written works being created every second that if you did nothing but read from daybreak till succumbing to sleep, you couldn't even keep up with 2% of the new material as it is created.  i work for a small business intelligence firm doing databases and analytics for catalog businesses. that's not exactly giving a huge landing pad for common ground but it's super interesting to me and i love the small team i work with. being really tall. and funny. and handsome. tall. sometimes. funny.  what?  sorry, i was seriously distracted by this ad just to the left that is asking me \"transgender? and have sex with men? take part in a study and earn $90\" and i'm wondering first of all, how many people are there who meet that criteria, and more importantly what the hell i could have googled to have that targeted at me. i get eyes a lot. music: anything electronic. if it has beats and synths i probably like it.  shows: game of thrones, firefly, veronica mars, battlestar galactica, breaking bad, deadwood, the wire  books: currently reading anathem (n stephenson) , before that was perdido st station (mieville) i'm of the opinion that there aren't really any insurmountable problems, there's only whatever issues you're working on right now, pretty much all of which can be solved by a big hot helping of man-the-fuck-up if you're afraid, or learning about it if you're clueless. i'm very stoic like that.  the greatest strength and the greatest curse about humans is our extreme adaptability in the face of adversity - when shit gets bad, we'll work something out. but the cruel barb attached to that is when stuff is going pretty good, we re-anchor our perceptions to the pretty good. so happiness and comfort tend to be moving targets rather than something you can distill into a list of 6.  that being said, a warm drink on a cool foggy san francisco morning is a pretty special little moment. and falling asleep with someone special while its raining outside. when i was a kid, i'd keep myself up at night thinking about my death. it was the scariest thing i'd ever thought of. neither of my parents are religious and i wasn't either, so i didn't have that comforting buffer of belief shielding my little 10-year old brain from the yawning chasm of existential despair. i mean, now the neurons are firing and thinking these thoughts! these! right now! but sometime, they will just... stop. that thought was the worst. i just imagined a roiling, endless, inchoate blackness everywhere, the absence of thought, and it made the pit of my stomach feel like it was dropping. there was nothing i could do about it! it's awful! i like living and i don't want to stop!  but i eventually made peace with it, somehow. there wasn't a eureka moment or anything, but more just accepting over time that you can't spend energy worrying about things that are outside of your control.  nowadays, i like to imagine how many fifth-graders i could take in a fight. like we're on a field, and there's an infinite number of them, and they're all rabid and trying to kill me, and i have to put down as many as i can before i succumb. i'm thinking i'm 6'1, 180, i'm in pretty decent shape, i should be able to get at least 25 as long as i can keep upright and stop too many from hanging onto my legs. i could use the first one as a club. equal chance i'm out getting blasted with my # 1 sister or at home playing vidya games. \"hey, welcome back to work cameron, did you have a good weekend?\" \"yeah! i went to %thing% with my friend %generic name% , it was pretty cool!\" shh. no, i didn't. i watched 40 hours of the wire punctuated only briefly by fitful sleep, refilling tea and emptying processed tea into the toilet. i don't always watch tv, but when i do, i watch entire seasons at a time. poor impulse control. you are interested in tall, funny, charming, stable men with a job. but how popular can that be, anyways?"

    "about": "i am originally from hawaii and will always be a beach girl at heart, but i have lived in sf for 8 years now and grown quite fond of the city and the surrounding adventures. i have a great group of friends that are like family, and we frequently will try new restaurants, have home cooked dinners or trek out of the city on the weekends to defrost and get some fresh air. making the most of it! i put a high priority on real friendships and family, and being goofy and laughing. i have a fun job in online advertising with gaming companies, and i like to keep myself busy with fun activities. now a days those have mostly been salsa dancing, hiking, surfing (learning to surf, don't imagine me shredding huge waves.. yet... ) and in the winter, learning how to ski. baking in general - i am in charge of baking the cake whenever one of my friends has a birthday. that i smile a lot and have a generally happy/cheerful personality. books: molokai, wild, i also have a hidden nerdy appreciation for science fiction so one of my all time favorite books is ender's game. as you might be able to tell from my screen name i also really enjoy gary larson the far side as well as calvin and hobbes... so clever.  favorite food is definitely sushi. close seconds are thai and italian. i also really like trying new places that have creative menus, and luckily there is a lot of that in san francisco  movies/tv: inception, zoolander, life is beautiful, mad men, grey's anatomy, modern family, how i met your mother sunshine close friends being active travel plans time for relaxation the ocean <-- preferably all in the same day :) what i want my next adventure to be & being thankful that life is good right now. usually at happy hour and/or dinner with friends. i'm allergic to dairy - its more inconvinient than you might think! you have a positive attitude and an active lifestyle. or if you have a favorite funny cat video on youtube you want to share. isn't that what the internet is for?"

    "about": "i escaped the manicured lawns and bored cops of orange county many years ago, and havent looked back since. sf has been my home for most of my adult life, and im proud to know all the best routes and hidden spots of the city, but still amazed by the things i discover day to day.  i like bare feet on sand, and wifi on the beach.  i prefer two wheels over four, but i love 4 wheel drive. i like being able to pack a weeks worth of life into a bag and just go... anywhere. if i have the time, i get off the interstate and try to get lost in the back country roads. i hate running on a treadmill.  i admire people with passion and/or talent, even if its for something weird. but not too weird.  i appreciate progressive thought and tolerance, and general giving-a-shit about something. my job involves iphones, storm troopers, mr. t, and source control.  i volunteer as a ymca mentor on the weekends, though i find i have a lot to learn from kids. when i discovered my 12-year old mentee had a girlfriend, i asked him why, and he shouted in his adhd way: \"do you wanna live and die alone?\" the next day, i joined okcupid.  i've been playing guitar since i was little, in the hopes of becoming the next jimi hendrix, but these days i just play chords and sing to myself when i know no ones listening.  i like to learn random do-it-yourself stuff. i know how to solder, replace a clutch, clean a carburetor, reupholster a car interior, re-grip a golf club, make a video game, and roast a chicken.  i just bought a micro four-thirds camera and it has revitalized my love for photography. it reminds me of the manual days, i only wish i had the time to do full darkroom type stuff.  after i retire, i'd like to make guitars in my garage. -finding the perfect parking spot after already parking 4 blocks away -picking up a new hobby, humbly realizing that i could probably master it if i tried, then forgetting about it and going to sleep. -thinking of all the things we'll need to go camping -breaking and then fixing things -finding trivial things to be really awesome -being funny, probably at my own expense my rock-hard abs and sculpted pecs. i didnt take a pic to show you because i didnt wanna seem too \"myspace\" food: anything but leftovers. sushi, izakaya, and spanish tapas are my favs, but i also can't say no to a good burger or super suiza carne asada quesadilla at 2am. cumin is my new favorite spice, try it on your next burger! i love my grill and i love bbqing, for one or for many.  music: i like to latch on to a whole album and i will listen it to the ground. recent faves: the national, new pornographers, matisyahu, edward sharpe, against me, bad religion, rise against, cake, i'm secretly in love with rihanna, and the magnetic zeros, the roots, j5, blackalicious, way too many to list all... i especially like music with some social commentary.  books: life of pi, game of thrones, vonnegut, the fountainhead, paradise lost, watchmen, fight club, the foundation series.  movies: everything christopher nolan has done, especially the prestige. artfully violent movies, like sin city and 300. i'll also watch any sci-fi movie, even if its horrible. flash gordon anyone? more normal movies: shawshank redemption, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, the thin red line, lord of the rings, the matrix. family+friends, laughter, new things, floss, my hands, a purpose theres a long tail of scattered thoughts i could probably never put into words. hangin out with friends. friday happy hour is the best. i dont really have rock-hard abs and sculpted pecs :("

    "about": "in an odd turn of events, i relocated to cooperstown, ny for seven months at the beginning of 2010. an interesting experience. did you know the baseball hall of fame is there? i take pride in the fact i never went in... i figure it was a greater thing for me to leave space available for someone who cared ;-) i took advantage of an opportunity to try something totally different, so i became a nanny for my friend's 7-month-old baby. i never had the urge to have a child of my own, and still don't, but recognized the gift to my life it would be to take care of a baby full-time. i learned patience and when to put the baby down and walk away for a while. we both survived.  i'm self-employed, therefore my location doesn't really matter, so i stayed out there after the main baby-maintenance was over and worked for a couple months before heading home. i've never lived anywhere but san francisco, and have only \"visited\" winter before, so this took me way outside my comfort zone on a lot of levels and i had a great time. now i am back in the bay area and looking to find someone interesting to meet and see what happens. i'm funny, i've been told i'm cute, dress up as needed, but am usually in jeans, can hold up my end of a conversation, like to listen, love to cook, go to movies, see live theater, enjoy the out doors, love to take long walks, can drive a stick shift, i can juggle, love photography, and love what i do for a living.  i am looking forward to adding someone special to my life, which is great as it is, so it can only get better with someone to share it with. yes? who the hell knows... attempting to appreciate it as it comes. i love how it is playing out and only pretend to control any of that, but am true to myself as best i can be. not solving the world's problems, nor developing the next big thing, but happy. hope to meet same. interpretive dance, on demand. okay, maybe not so much but i'll give it a shot. i usually have a really snarky response, maybe not the best tactic but, to be honest, i think this question is kind of stupid. i love to read, but will admit to reading a lot of crap. not all fun stuff, but not all life-changing. just read the hunger games series. won't learn the cure for cancer with it, but really had a great time spending time on my couch totally enthralled. i love to learn new authors to appreciate. my taste in film is rather eclectic, foreign to movies that go boom! musically, i have recently developed a great affection for alternative rock: linkin park, slipknot, kings of leon, etc. i never listened to much rock before, more of a product of the late 80s new wave ilk. reading through this makes me realize i might be pretty shallow or have really low standards. could work for me or against me. hmmm.  my cousin recently took me to a guitar concert by tommy emmanuel. i'd not been to a live concert in a smallish venue in a while and really enjoyed the whole experience. i definitely want to see more live entertainment, music and plays!  i love food and love to cook. i especially enjoy making a meal with friends, or someone special. i also enjoy eating out, but am not a big fan of eating out alone, so there are plenty of places i'd like to try with a new friend! here are six things i find important in my daily life, in no particular order: electrical outlets, a towel, a wacom tablet, a camera, a chair, clean underwear. sometimes i contemplate the additional matches that show up on the lower right of someone's profile i am perusing. more kinky? less adventurous? more loving? less social? new favorite: less mathematical! huh? crud, if i knew a math quiz would be involved, i would have studied more! what does that indicate about the person whose profile i am looking at? makes me very curious about who shows up as alternatives on my profile... obvy, it depends on who is looking, but what am i \"more\" or \"less\" than? hmmmm. contemplating the abyss, or perhaps watching a movie. i have my own set of allen wrenches. if you like witty conversation, don't take yourself too seriously, are happy in your own life, enjoy the arts in some manner, like taking long walks about town or traipsing around the local hills, have a job you enjoy that isn't your whole life, and think i am cute, go ahead and say hello!"

i'm really good at being clumsy, i mean, i never fall, but often trip. oops. considering the world of hypothetical questions. laughing at inappropriate times. being honest almost to a fault. sleeping is really awesome, i'm pretty good at that. i can have a very dry wit. books:  fight club 1984 brave new world guns, germs and steel i read a lot of non fiction. i like history and science a lot. i keep telling myself i'm going to start reading ender's game, but it just sits on the shelf unread. sorry ender's game!  movies: studied film in college, so i've been exposed to most everything. drawn to neorealism and new wave, but i enjoy sci-fi (good or bad) and low brow comedies. i dig fellini, but sometimes billy madison is the answer. michel gondry made awesome music videos. eternal sunshine hurts cause it's so good. that danny boyle guy makes a good flick every now and then  tv shows: i like tv, don't get me wrong, but i am easily sucked into watching it. i try to avoid it mostly. a friend and i recently dusted off the sealab 2021 dvd, uh oh. when i do watch, it's usually things like always sunny, the league, undercover boss, science and history programs, mythbusters. i haven't seen an episode of madmen, but it's on the to do list.  lost, quantum leap, reading rainbow, entourage, knight rider, air wolf, mtv (when they played music videos), star trek, battlestar galactica  i am uncontrollably drawn to reality shows.  music: i played the saxophone in 4th grade. i got scolded during lessons because i danced too much. in 5th grade i switched it up and played the trombone. in 6th grade i decided to retire the horn instruments and focus on playing more video games. i own a guitar, but don't really know how to play it. in college i found myself with technics, a mixer, and a plethora of vinyl. thus i began mixing beats. i used to spin some house and trance back in the day, so i have a huge appreciation for electronic music... as a young'in my first music purchase was a boyz ii men cd. my second: pearl jam. i still love those two bands (can we call boyz ii men a \"band\"?) my most recent music purchase: m83. i miss old hip hop/rap. depeche mode's \"enjoy the silence\" is a flawless song. i wish a tribe called quest would make another album. i will look for u2 and prince on the jukebox. i will act out the lyrics of a song as it plays. radiohead, broken social scene, burial, paul van dyk, the cure, people under the stairs, one be lo, animal collective, cut copy, memory tapes, sunny day real estate, tupac, enduser, placebo, gorillaz,  food: trying to eclectizize (is that a word?) my food habits, lets go out and try some weird food! with that said a good burrito is always welcomed. recently i've embraced greek yogurt. i like cheese. no, wait - i love cheese. i am fond of spinach. i was a vegetarian for a couple of years. no more. i like to cook, but i don't like to clean. whiskey, vodka, tea, wine, soda water with some lemons. morning star veggie sausage patties. cheese. cheese. no, seriously, cheese.  ...i don't what category mitch hedberg falls under so i will create a mitch hedberg category here. i like mitch hedberg... mitch hedberg. . a toothbrush . baseball . my trusty phone . laptop . wit . spell checking why the people in front of me are driving so slow and horrible. you would think a slower driver is a safer driver, not always true. avoiding lines in grocery and department stores, hate it. on another note; i wonder if kids these days even know what a library is? if my life was a movie, what song would be playing right now? do i need gas for my car? where did i park my car? burning a new mixtape. what time it is, what's happening on my phone. how to make the day productive. food. people watching. the san francisco giants. sex. storylines, plots, baseball, boobs, witty nothings, making a to do list of to do lists. working. do you want fries with that?

    "about": "i'm a hard worker, and a genuine honest mature person.  i'm an idealistic sort of person. i am fascinated and delighted by living things, including insects, mammals, and other animals. same for nonliving things like the ocean and the stars.  the first thing you'll notice about me is my zest for life. i'm educated, professionally successful, independent, smart, happy, loyal, supportive, easy-going, energetic... in summary, nearly perfect ;) but always looking for self-improvement.  i'm learning to love life more and more as i move through it and i'd like to continue learning as much as i can forever. a skill i pride myself on is being able to step into the shoes of the other and i'm constantly surprised that there is always an explanation for a person's actions/feelings/ perspectives.  i feel that a single box to summarize any person is laughable, so i will just leave you with this for now:  ...a quote by carl jung: \"the meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances: if there is any reaction, both are transformed.\" graduate school! work! internships!  on a day to day basis, i strive to learn as much as i can about the people, places, and things around me. i try to live as a glass half-full person, though i guess certain realms of the world tend to draw out my cynicism (politics especially).  i'm currently in my last year of being an eternal grad student. i'm independent, and well versed in life (or so i like to think so, lol). i pride myself for being easy going, nice, low key, down to earth, drama free, and well rounded. and for a final list of positive attributes, i'm a mature decent guy who tries to be funny, respectful, (and more...) lastly, i don't lie, steal, cheat, or manipulate! i epitomize kindness. car stuff school stuff conversation  i prefer to think of myself as pretty good at many things rather than really good at a few things. ultimately, i will try my hardest to be the best at everything - it's the competitive edge in me.  being goofy occasionally. and by \"occasionally,\" i mean \"most of the time.\" my mother says it's not ladylike, but i really think she's just jealous of the variety of faces i can make at passersby.  asking questions. (hopefully with my head cocked thoughtfully to one side, as though appearing to listen, even though i'm really just silently judging you.) george saunders quote: \"fuck concepts. don't be afraid to be confused. stay confused. try to remain permanently confused. stay open forever, so open it hurts, and then open up some more, until the day you die, world without end, amen.\" well, most of the books i read are for school. i rarely get to enjoy reading for the sake of reading, although i would if i could. cars are a large focus of my recreational time. inquire within! i am most interested in the interplay between the internal and the external worlds, as in mind vs. matter, fantasy vs. reality and intention vs. action. because of this, i enjoy internal reflection and meditation as well as delving into the inner world of anyone else who will let me. then i think about it and try to understand it and see about bringing the good i see there out into the world. i was raised by hippies.  i'm unique. it takes a special person to understand what i have to offer.  i'm secretly organizing an collective of philosophically like-minded folks querying the existence of stereotypes, standards, and restrictions that may limit the boundaries of our existence. you think there might be a connection to make here, or you have something to say, or you are intrigued by anything you read.  you are a down to earth person who doesn't live in a myopic mentality.  you don't have to be an intellectual to get along with me. i'm easy going in the true sense of the word.  you are kind of attractive, kind of stylish, definitely interesting, and by interesting i mean interesting, not crazy. but if you're crazy i'll probably fall in love with you. if you're an artsy type, nice. if you're honest, yes please.  i'm pretty forward and honest person; therefore, i don't like wasting time beating around the bush. with that being said, i don't like playing dating games; if i like you, i like you. if i don't, then i don't. there's just too much to experience in this world. i rather not waste time on or be concerned about people who don't like me."

    "about": "(i'm normally a believer in brevity, but friends convinced me to write more, so nyahh, enjoy the full britannica).  aloha!  after a productive jam session with a particularly talented guitarist/songwriter friend of mine, we were crossing the street and he pointed to the cross-walk guy on the streetlight. \"i want that guy, coming out of the darkness. that's the sound i'm looking for\". \"yeah, but like this\" i replied and then mimed the figure popping up onto one leg like he's posing for a still camera as if running. \"it would make it even more surreal and dream like\". the conversation went on like that, and included a brief exploration of whether rollerskates or rollerblades were more disorienting and of the fantasy of the night.  lolwut? trying to figure out a complex math equation expressed through sound tasked with creating a visceral feeling we were discussing recreational transportation and lights designed to make crossing the street orderly. things like this trip me out.  word.  i'm a dedicated musician finishing a degree that both teaches and criticizes economics. i think in shapes and narratives and am the most intellectual right brained person you'd have ever met. i'm more than a little adhd but i'm lucky in that one of the things i can really focus on is conversations. so let's talk sometime.  i come across pretty non serious but that's because the small stuff is all fun and games. my big picture thinking and my upbringing informed me this: it's realistic if someone's done it before. and it might be realistic even if it hasn't. i've already done things informed people told me was impossible. i can be snarky sometimes, and a bit contrarian sometimes, but never cynical. my \"personality\" tab is fairly accurate. fairly. apparently loosely keeping a budget makes me the most organized man my age. maybe the staff robot knows i can handle chaos.  anyway, i have to make sure i don't wallow in my own ambition, however, or nothing gets done. took me a long time to realize that. it's one of three reasons i've still got one last year as an undergrad. holler -.- ... i showed up ready to change the world and found out college was still school. took me a bit to get my scholastic groove back, which included dropping out to become a superstar dj--since which i have largely tabled in favor of a much more rewarding and centered path of music composition. i was almost a music major when i came back, but i would have been in school until i was 27-28. yeesh. (truth be told university is so much better being older anyway. it's much easier to learn when you're no longer trying to have the whole \"college experience\").  the aesthetic of having secret bases hiding in plain site in unfriendly territory has gripped me since i was little.  i'm not big on personal labels but i'm a feminist and that's important to me. a big hairy deep-voiced testosterone fueled feminist.  i photobomb frequently because it's the right thing to do. sending love wherever i can. i'm split in a couple worlds--just today i went to a burner crowd day party and danced with the hippiest among them; in a month i'll be in a suit pitching some technology to oversized corporations.  for the second half of summer i'll be in boston just down the street from the berklee school of music composing/arranging/finding instrumentalists and singers for a game soundtrack i am tasked to do. it's funny, you spend years learning how to *not* sound like video game music only to find it difficult when you actually want to. i like a challenge though and i navigate my daw like a dolphin in water. i gotta come up for air but i'm swimming fine.  this is a stark contrast from last summer which i spent working in the finance district of chicago. i actually loved that and while i know there's a lot of hate for bankers/traders/etc these days, it's largely unwarranted. i soaked up a lot of knowledge and am currently thinking of novel trading algorithms but that's more of a side gig. that said, i was definitely the most leftwing person to ever step foot in that building. only my boss had any idea.  mostly i'm trying to squeeze in quality time with friends and family because in the end no empire is worth more than our relationships with one another. keeping long term friendships.  keeping secrets.  i think those two are related.  hearing things in music that aren't meant to be heard. have you ever really heard an acoustic guitar? you know, when strumming hits the right groove and suddenly there's a drummer, arpeggiation, chords, 3 kinds of resonance, and 6 mariachi singers wailing out of the middle harmonizing with some random other guy? or how justin timberlake's \"cry me a river\" does the chorus's call and response production backward, making him vulnerable like sitting sad on a barstool on a stage under an interrogation light with no visible audience, too dried out to cry anymore - not the cocky voice he pretends to be throughout. brightly framed colorful sunglasses i bought for $5. dance music moves me. i've loved it since my best childhood friend bootlegged me a cassette back in 1993 called \"sf rave x-plosion\". i was hooked. it is hands down the worst electronic music you will ever hear. i have no idea why anyone spent the money to publish that thing. it's like someone connected a drum machine and a broken gameboy to a tape player and occasionally said random things like \"casper was a friendly ghost\". man i wish i could find a copy.  some of my favorites are a little obscure, like the presets, but i love daft punk, the pet shop boys, the autokratz, morphine, yuksek, chemical brothers, deadmau5 (to my chagrin), green day, offspring, rhapsody of fire, john b (no, not the soul singer), parliament, the prodigy, metric, omd, wallpaper.  i grew up listening to a lot of alt-rock, some metal, and the likes, so i have an appreciation for guitars and softer singers. i think there aren't enough women singers in rock music. got into hip hop by forcing myself to listen to it back in high school, and i will occasionally freestyle raps about political economy when i walk long distances. the hayek vs keynes rap has nothing on my flow.  i have a secret love affair with pop music. 80s, 90s, modern, i think it's great stuff. in fact, the worse it is, the better. i sing a mean tearin' up my heart. just the basics, plus a synthesizer, an amplifier, and a tan colored shirt that reads \"i'm so gay i shit rainbows\". because it's ironic to still be ironic in 2012. lyrics, rhythms, and sex. i love to dance and i love to chat at trashy crowded dive bars but these days i'm often at home working on music. i collect mini vodka bottles after meeting strangers on the plane and drinking with them.  i make a lot of really dry jokes, and dry jokes making fun of dry jokes. you're passionate and kind, and you think i'd like you a lot.  (if you answered stale is to steal incorrectly, and marked the correct answer as red, please don't contact me.)  ciao"

    "about": "i love this city, because despite my eccentricities i am still not the weirdest weirdo in the bunch. south carolina born and bred, i cut my adult teeth in the uk and now plan to be in sf until they kick me out.  defining myself outside of my job is difficult, so i tend to be drawn towards creative types who live their work. quirky characters with a unique sense of style and appreciation for all things alternative.  clothes don't make the man, but they do push my buttons. if you're wearing predominantly sportswear or a helmet in your pictures we're already in trouble. i love a tattooed & pierced smart dresser who wears suits outside work hours and the occasional wedding. shaved heads are practically a fetish.  i'm a serial non-monagamist. my ideal \"relationship\" looks like a good friendship, except with ridiculous chemistry. the key to success being a lack of expectations and jealousy. visiting airports. i've been an adult model for 6 years and counting, in almost every medium over the years. school always came easy, but i've finally accepted that \"pornographer\" is what i want to be when i grow up. i surround myself with \"deviants\" into bdsm, sex work, body mods, queer culture, etc.  not to say you have to be a freak on the outside, but you definitely have to be a freak on the inside. intense physical attraction is very important to me and my submissive nature prefers experienced partners. for the sake of efficiency, size matters to an extent and if your idea of sex doesn't include equipment you must at least own lube.  social politics are very important to me and being anti gay marriage, abortion, comprehensive sex education or sex work is a hard limit. allergic to religion. marion zimmer bradley, jacqueline carey, anne rice (ex-goth kid yes), ian m banks, isabel allende, robin maxwell, sci-fi/fantasy, period dramas, well written books about alternative sexuality. my non-fiction chops are poor.  the house of yes, a history of violence, lolita, downloading nancy, the great happiness space, period dramas, documentaries about nature & religious fantatics/cults/mormons/polygamy, anything with david attenborough's voice.  spartacus: blood and sand, the tudors, true blood, carnivale, raising hope, cartoons - adult and not so adult, game of thrones, the daily show, colbert report, stand up comedy.  ludacris, diplo, major lazer, sam cooke, ray charles, otis redding, basement jaxx, little dragon, john coltrane, snoop dogg, bill withers, lil wayne, cinematic orchestra. hip hop, funk/soul, chick-on-piano music, dub step, nostalgic classic rock. there's a time and a place for everything.  snacks-as-a-food-group, excessively sharp cheddar, beer/ wine, coffee, meats. beef jerky, boiled peanuts, ranch dressing and all things southern. i like to cook when alone. 1. carbonated beverages 2. fur babies for the unconditional love. 3. playing dress up. 4. absorbing the internet through rss feeds. 5. quality california medicine. 6. fat pants. for when dress up time is over. converting 4000 sq ft of centrally located warehouse space into a beautiful oasis with sophie_monroe, the platonic other half of my essence (and our 3 cats, the closest i will ever get to children).  costumes, whore heels, tiny hats, fake lashes, latex, drag wigs, makeup. assembling the perfect outfit. the closest i get to creating is manipulating my look. shallow on the surface, but an occupational necessity. \"friday\" is just an arbitrary day when you are not a 9-5er. between work trips i'm usually at home with the bong under one arm and the cat under the other.  i need someone who can push me out of the house. dinner, drinks, shopping, movies, anything people! almost. not one to sweat with my clothes on unless the company or view is spectacular. it might take some convincing to make me wear your helmet. i'm looking for a passionate, hard worker who pays attention. i'm no money chaser, but i'm past my man child phase and on to grown men. over 30 is great.  i love a geek with polish, but i don't mesh well with the socially awkward. masculine, dominant men without bro tendencies really suit my laid back attitude. i soak up enthusiastic energy like a sponge.  i'm a direct communicator with limited time for play and no time for a boyfriend, so i want an uncomplicated adventure. i'm away a lot, so texting ridiculousness is practically required to keep me interested. i can promise i hold up my end of the bargain.  i've completely lost the war with replying to my inbox unless i'm interested, but i read every message. - you are the tall (cliche i know, but i like to feel overpowered), dark (or shaved) and handsome type. a pretty face is good, but an interesting one is better. facial hair is a hard limit. - you agree that a 15 pound cat with a pimp limp is super awesome. - you can manipulate a masochist. - you aren't just visiting, looking for a 3some or in a live in serious relationship."

    "about": "i have a hybrid life. a little solar powered and a little fuel injected. i grew up in a small town in northern california and can feel comfortable off the grid or in a large metropolitan city. i guess that is why i love the bay area, it has elements of both.  when i am craving nature, i love to head over to marin. i do hit the east bay regional park system all the time after work, but i have to admit our parks are a little scruffy compared to the majesty of marin. just the other day it seemed to me that even the wildflowers were just a little more attractive over there.  the arts and creativity are really dear to me. if i were alive during the italian renaissance i would have liked being a member of the medici familyfostering visual and literary expression. i am in both a reading and writing group and i am still awe-struck by a well-crafted sentence. i am not so much a producer of art as an admirer and i see lots of theater, spoken word, films, museum exhibits, and music concerts. i find it inspiring.  traveling and living abroad has opened my mind and definitely shaped my personality. in my 20s i lived and studied in latin america a couple of times. i imagined hanging out with poets and revolutionaires and instead was part of a studio audience for a cheesy live television show and danced merengue. a couple of years ago, i got to live like a local in a family's apartment in paris while they stayed at my place. i like the leap of faith you take by swapping places with a stranger.  i love to laugh. you know that kind of belly aching fall on the floor laughter...i have been told that i sometimes laugh to myself. i am easily amused by the little things around me. like for some reason, i keep running into angela davis and it brings a grin to my face. at the dry cleaners, at the thai restaurant, in yoga class, out walking our dogs around the lake. i was never part of the black panther movement, but it seems we run in the same circles now.  two of my favorite people are my niece and nephew who never cease to amaze me with their sense of wonder. i love to be in nature with them. they constantly remind me of the joy of discovery. probably my most cherished possession is my old bicycle that i ride to work. i am often drawn to the ocean and have recently discovered open water swimming in the bay. i have never had a dream that i am flying, but i have had breathing under water dreams. it just seems right. i work at an inner-city elementary school. i feel blessed to have a job that is never a dull moment and hopefully has a positive impact on the kids and families i work with. my taste runs the gamut from kirtan chanting to dolly parton to mahler symphonies to almodovar movies to the alexander mcqueen fashion retrospective at the met. i saw a multi-media exhibit at the sfmoma a few years back that deeply moved me and made me wish i were the artist's niece or second cousin. i am often transfixed when i watch people perform and get to witness someone utterly absorbed in the moment and following their passion. water in all forms travel network spinal analysis art in many forms the senses love not thinking- or at least moving towards observing my thoughts rather than believing all of them. i have been exploring meditation and mindfulness for a few years now and enjoy learning more about the connection between science and spirituality. i am looking for a man who has a big heart, a spirit of adventure and positive energy. someone who shares a commitment to personal and spiritual growth. a man who enjoys his work and also loves to kick back and enjoy life:)"

    "about": "dear (your name here), i am writing this letter to you because if at the end of it you feel like you can fill your name in the first line you should write me back. i'm going to tell you a secret: i'm ready to meet someone totally random and maybe it's you. i've got a dusty heart. i'm like every other woman on the surface: i want someone sweet and fun and hot and exciting. i want someone who is self sufficient and someone who blends into me as well as i blend into them. i want someone smart and someone who doesn't care if i don't look like a model or if i work out less than 5 times a week. i want someone who appreciates my faults and laughs at my jokes. i want someone who thinks i am beautiful and sexy and doesn't care i'm not 25 anymore. i want someone who sleeps at home and at my house too. i want someone to want to really know me. i've had many amazing connections with men in the past, all unique and exciting, some boring, some just plain wrong, but all educational. i'm very non-traditional on some levels and alarmingly normal in others. i'm tough and funny and sensitive. i'm a terrible dater and even worse at these f---ing profiles. i'm like a truffle: either you can't get enough or you keep me off your plate entirely. i'm an acquired taste. i'm very extroverted but somewhere have lost my ability to flirt effectively. i don't want to play dumb girl games and i don't want to play by stupid arbitrary dating rules. i believe that first impressions are very informative and meaningful. i think someone's smell is what reels me in. i'm very physical and open and affectionate. but you have to earn it. i've had some pretty awesome near misses with love and it's made me a believer but at heart i am an empiricist: i need proof. i don't want to do protracted emailing and all that but i'm going to talk to you for a bit. if you like me, we both are going to know pretty quickly and if you have to think about it too long you don't. but you have to meet me first. i'm self employed. i am a hairstylist and and educator for a professional hair color company. i work as much as i can to support my sf living and i love my job. i have a creative and fun career that may seem superficial on the outside but it uses more of the brain than you may give it credit for. as a color educator i teach the technology and chemistry of products to people with varying ranges of intellect and interest. it's a humbling experience. i also am a classical soprano soloist and avid science freak. my fantasy date: lawrence livermore physics lab. they do tours!!! i have fun friends and a great apartment that i am in no hurry to lose. i like my life i just want more. singing. i kill it at karaoke. i sing in a choir and take voice. reading. i have a room full of old sci-fi and textbooks. learning. i love taking classes, i always am doing something at city college for fun. i've taken some creative writing and psychology classes too. working. i feel useless if i'm not busy enough. it's my midwestern work ethic. talking. i do it for a living. my hair. i'm short. i like to get a tan in the summer. my sense of humor. philip k dick, jonathan lethem, don delillo, george saunders...l like funny weird dystopian speculative ideas and voices. tv: so much good, so little time: hbo can really do no wrong. game of thrones, boardwalk empire, eastbound, girls...all great. californication. space 1999. british comedy. music: many kinds movies: i love anything with questionable production value; really bad horror, i like kung fu, western, david cronenberg of the 80s. i love thriller, spy, i actually like army movies too, especially movies about submarines. i'd love to go on a sub ride. my least favorite genre: rom-com. if i get caught up in one of those uterus yankers i gotta turn it off because either i can't respect myself for crying or i get mad that the prince charming fantasy is re-propagated one jennifer aniston character at a time. food: italian, indian, asian, steak n potatoes. im not a vegetarian or vegan. i don't drink soy milk and though espousing a gluten free diet is all the rage i need my wheat toast n butter in the morning. i'm a cheap date i'm not a big seafood person. i'm from wisconsin, that might explain some things. warm comfy house. sex. it's life's greatest joy. seriously. food. really in the running with sex for life's greatest joy. something interesting to watch/read/look at. i like information inflow. company. i need people around me most of the time, being alone for extended periods is tough on my soul. i think too much. my 87 honda - i love her. why i don't put up this profile. i'm tired of feeling sorry for myself and it's time to pull my head out of the sand. i also think about the big existential questions, not so much the why are we here questions but more the wtf am i going to do with myself questions. what's my next career? how can i make myself happier? it's all well and good to operate on the amoeba level but i feel like there is something bigger out there waiting for me to find it. i think dating is by far my worst nightmare and biggest challenge. i think about getting older, how fast time is flying, how i've lived in sf for 15 years already. i really need a new chapter in my book because the one i've been on i've read too many times. home. surprise! saturday is my biggest work day so being hungover on a saturday just isn't appealing to me anymore. i'd be up to shaking that up however. most normal people have the weekend off and i don't. just the way my job works. umm, nothing i want to reveal like this. gotta leave some mystery. one thing i am embarrassed to admit: i am woefully under-traveled. the most exotic place i have been to is hawaii. i don't have a passport. i want that to change. you really honestly think i look at all like a real dating possibility. here's where i get to be honest about you: i'm looking for someone who doesn't have to be like me as a guy, he doesn't have to like everything i do. i want to meet someone who has something to share with me, a new interest i might acquire, a new place to go, a new way to feel. remind me i am an intriguing woman and someone you want to be around. i'd love to go out with someone who wants to explore possibilities!"

    "about": "i grew up in southern california but have made san francisco my home. having lived here for 10 years, i'm really enjoying the diversity and the great friendships i've made. my friends are my family. each one of them fosters and reflects a different aspect of my personality.  my friends are of all age group. of all shapes and sizes and color. yeah i'm pretty blessed.  if i have to describe personality, i'm a low key t-shirts and jeans kind of guy. i easily laugh at myself and try not to take things too seriously.  i can have a crazy night on minute and turnaround and have a slow pace evening the next. one moment i may be playing softball for two days, the next, i'm glued to my couch and television for hours. cycling for 50 miles and the next a nice stroll through the gg park.  i hope to find someone that will push me to be a better person and at the same time want me to push him to grow as well.  i realized long ago the shortest distance between two points isn't always a straight line. looking forward to the destination and enjoying the journey.  i like to stay active. i recently discovered yoga and really enjoy it though i'm still just a beginner. i've been part of the sf gay softball league for the last 4 years and it's been a major part of my social life. two years ago i trained for the aids/lifecycle. but an inflamed patella tendon from a training ride forced me to bow out. i mostly cycle to and from work these days. though next year, i hope to try again and do the 7 day ride from sf to la.  i snowboarded the swiss alps. i've visited the vatican. driven across the states 3 times, twice with my parents and once to see a friend off to harvard business school. swam in a sacred cenote in the yucatan. climbed kukulcan pyramid at chichen-itza. took a week long bus ride through northern mexico. ate reindeer in helsinki. woke to the view of the matterhorn from a snow covered cabin. hop the islands of hawaii. i'm a software engineer. i'm doing iphone development these days. i'm really enjoying it. though i dream one day to save up enough to open up a bar. i have a social side that i want to encourage and foster. making people laugh, both at me and at themselves. i don't try to take things too serious. don't sweat the small stuff... and really, it's all small stuff.  oh, i'm really getting into cooking too. my height? my forehead? i don't know, you tell me ;-) books: siddhartha, the power of now, einstein's dreams. don't sweat the small stuff.. and really it's all small stuff.  movies: star wars, anything sci-fi. comic book movies, challenging movies: primer, momento, donnie darko, eternal sunshine of a spotless mind. movies with heart: pixar movies, color purple, pretty woman, 50 first dates.  music: anything but rap. (yup, even country has a place on my playlist). im overplaying gary go, robyn, katy perry, mat kearny recently.  food: can't go wrong with italian. sushi. i'm pretty adventurous. i once had reindeer tartar, escargot, and frog legs (tasted like chicken). family friends my ipod of music the sun the beach courtesy a lot of time in self reflection. i'm not sure i can live the unexamined life. catching up with friends over a drink, a movie, and/or a dinner. i don't have many secrets. you ask, i tell.  oh yeah, i cried in toy story 2, toy story 3, and up.  recently i've been having a reoccurring dream about this backburnered idea for a mobile app. it's still rough on the edges but i think there's potential there.  i take pictures of food i cook. it's kind of silly. you're open, honest, and real."

    "about": "\"ricky was \"l\" but he's home with the flu, lizzie, our \"o,\" had some homework to do, mitchell, \"e\" prob'ly got lost on the way, so i'm all of the love that could make it today.\"  uncle shelby  i like talking to people. i don't take myself too seriously. i love dictionaries. dancing makes me happy. by playing the piano i can get rid of any headache (does that work for anyone else?). i enjoy racquetball. broccoli is yucky, and so is cilantro. i like driving and i respect people who are good drivers. yet fancy cars don't impress me. i got hooked on foos in grad school and still love it. i like making things with my hands. a home is not a home without plants. i volunteer. i've never met a jar i couldn't open. i like expressive social games, like \"pictionary\", \"wise and otherwise\", and \"dixit\". spam subject lines entertain me. i am not a risk taker, but i love a good adventure. tv is a black hole that sucks up your time. (\"you don't own a tv? what's all your furniture pointed at?\") i like digital photography. i don't like ice cream. i never have nightmares. i like myself, i like my life. i am happy.  so, this is who i am. who are you? (the former 3 adjectives: brainy, kind, and curious.) - generally, figuring out where i fit in the grand scheme of things. or where it fits in me.  - specifically, working in high tech and planning how to make the world a better place and have fun doing it. my current projects are in healthcare, which makes me happy.  on a side note, i cheerfully consider myself a geek, although not a nerd; the important distinction is that nerds are basically geeks who don't shower. [i get a lot of comments on this. why, yes, this *is* the official definition.]  - exploring the bay area and making friends with the natives.  my goal is to live generously, laugh at myself, plunge into adventure, and make every day amazing. if this resonates with you, we may get along well. growing plants, giving hugs, teaching kids, making crepes, staying up late, data mining/machine learning. i do only one of these for money; i bet you can guess which one. someone here sent me a message, saying it was my witch hat. go figure... i discovered somerset maugham's novels at the impressionable age of 13, and i have been (re)reading his stuff ever since. of human bondage, the moon and sixpence, cakes and ale, and the razor's edge - all wonderful... *and* available at project gutenberg - go get them now!  another favorite writer, who trumps mr. maugham by a little, but only by the virtue of being still alive and writing, is john irving. i discovered him about 10 years ago with the water-method man - completely by accident, when i picked up a mis-shelved book in the library. i have yet to find something by him that i haven't thoroughly enjoyed; one of my favorites is a prayer for owen meany. if i could write like mr. irving, i wouldn't ask for anything else.  a couple of favorite poets - jacques prvert and sergei yesenin. at the risk of sounding snobbish i'll say that both should be read in the original, or there's a magnitude of difference. this applies to all literature to some extent, but especially to poetry... and especially to one's favorite poetry, don't you find? :) both guys are long dead, by the way. oh, and it's fascinating to me that by the time yesenin was my age, he'd married 5 times, fathered 4 children, become one of the most popular poets of the day, and committed suicide. that's some fast living.  i also read and enjoy a lot of non-fiction. i recommend the end of poverty, worldchanging, collapse, the world without us, the disappearing spoon, the invisible gorilla, a short history of nearly everything and the several postsecret books that are out. also, i've been quite taken by michael pollan's books recently and wish i had discovered him years ago.  among my favorite films are fight club, tampopo, shrek, the matrix, amelie, corpse bride, lon, groundhog day, amadeus, love actually, bend it like beckham, avatar and the gently strange works of almodovar. something i refuse to watch is horror movies.  music-wise, i keep on discovering new artists and styles i like. some old favorites are caetano veloso, carmen consoli, annie lennox, norah jones, pink martini, queen, ella fitzgerald. i unashamedly sing along with simon and garfunkel, the beatles, they might be giants, elvis, and abba, especially during long car trips with friends. however, i have less luck finding friends who also enjoy opera as much as i do. i've been disappointed by some modern attempts at opera, but if you can recommend a \"hidden gem\", i'd like to hear from you.  favorite food?  the long answer is: my omnivore palate and my vegetarian conscience debate where to set my eating boundaries. over the years the vegetarian side has been steadily gaining ground, which pleases me.  but the short answer is: tomatoes and feta cheese. how come we need exactly six? perhaps this is a conformity test...  humor, friends, independence, npr, my heart, my brain, and quite possibly some other organs.  some things i would *prefer* not to do without: travel, sesame seeds, wikipedia, eyesight, heels, salt, garrison keillor's voice, tea, electricity, community involvement, books, the smell of cooking onions, great hugs, semicolons. human nature. the environment. technology. the future. tomatoes and feta cheese.  also: how to bring the amazing love&joy of the playa to the world at large; how to create a similar secular temple space *out here* that moves, soothes, uplifts and unifies. (thoughts?) having friends or couchsurfers visit from far away places. dancing. playing board games. solving trigonometry equations for fun ... oh wait, this was supposed to go into the next section. i judge you when you use bad grammar. there; now you know.  in the same vein, i struggle with whether to put the dot inside or outside of a quoted phrase which comes at the end of a sentence. inside seems to be the american standard, but outside is where my heart yearns to put it. it's tough.  (if this makes sense to you, you may enjoy this xkcd strip.)  oh, and i admit that sometimes i take quite a while to reply to messages here... sorry! wait, let me rephrase that. i am terrible at replying to messages here. as a girl, i get a ton of them, and even though this sounds like a good thing, it isn't. i get a chance to respond to very very few of them, because the good ones get lost among all the \"your hot/have sex with me/my wife/we have nothing in common but i'm sure we'll get along great, write me back/why haven't you written me back\" ones, and also because i run out of steam. so, sadly, some lovely messages from lovely people go unanswered. my loss, i know. also, i know it's not fair, but if you want to get through, you might have to be quite persistent and/or creative. ... your favorite euro coins are the ones from portugal.  ... you want to build one of these with me.  ... you know the world's funniest joke (i do and i want to make sure you've got the right one).  ... you can teach me something interesting.  ... you are happy and you know it."

    "about": "i'm paul, i work way too much, i'm trying to change that. the book \"shop class as soulcraft\" pretty well defines how i feel about a lot of things.  i like industrial history and cry when someone knocks over an old factory or warehouse to build a house farm (thank god for the housing market crash!).  i have a fondness for machines with multiple well fit moving parts.  i am not particularly active and don't understand attraction of team sports or scoring systems. rebuilding carburetors, working full-full time at two jobs, trying not to buy anymore project cars until at least a couple of them can drive, trying to be fiscally responsible. learning how to be self employed and not fail at it. elbow deep in old car parts and solvents. procrastination, spending my paycheck in silly little increments or alternatively on large impulse buys. kicking-ass, where ass-kicking is appropriate. walking up to people's broken cars in a parking lot, touching something under the hood and fixing the car, and walking away all cool like. sometimes when i first meet people i'm kind of quiet so maybe they think i'm cool, see, but really i'm just sometimes socially awkward. also sometimes i'm funny and engaging and wildly inappropriate. here's a cross-section of my taste in things: i like tom robbins, chuck palahniuk , jeffrey eugenides, david sedaris, and factory repair manuals. i like edgar wright and wes anderson because every time they make a movie it's my favorite. i like gogol bordello, david bowie, qotsa, the kinks, the smiths, the clash, little brother, el-p, and many, many, many others. i tend to love music or despise it, and i understand how this makes me kind of an asshole sometimes. i like the venture brothers, the colbert report, and the office. i read npr, huffington post, and jalopnik all day. there isn't much food i won't try, and it turns out i like most of it. i cook a mean \"bachelor chow.\" -having free time. -road trips! working late, partying later. the future sometimes scares the shit out of me. you think you might like to."

(but love's a struggle, right?)  i spend a lot of time watching the world around me. i have a deep and complicated love affair with the bay (and sometimes a mild hatred for it as well, but i suppose that's to be expected with places we know so intimately) and spend a lot of time noticing its quirky beauty, wisdom, and contradictions.  and, i bake chocolate chip cookies, rummage through old photos, paint the walls of my bedroom, trip over my own feet, try to find places to dig in the dirt, and belt out songs i don't know the words to. - hiking big mountains and having sore quads the next day. - giving seriously high quality hugs. (no, like really good ones.) - communicating, talking, sharing, processing, brainstorming, conflict resolute-ing... - being a crazy anal copy-editor. - playing jewish geography (the game that goes: \"oh, you're from _____! do you know _______?!\"). - enjoying parentheses, because i always have a lot of thoughts in my head and they help me attempt to document my tangential brain. my curls, and my innate inability to live according to strange social norms.  and, that i ask a lot of questions. sometimes more than appropriate, but i suppose that's one of those social norms i don't know how/want to live by. (and because i honestly want to learn about the people that i'm walking in this crazy world with...) justice and injustice.  leaving. i often ponder packing up my backpack and seeking out the next adventure. but lately, i've realized that my challenge now is to stay. i've been trying to live here, grounded back in (nearly) my hometown, as i exist when i'm traveling:  i want to see the possibilities here and be intentional with my time in the same way i am when i only have a few weeks in any given city. i want to meet people, and then their friends, and then people through those people, and together build a deeply interconnected global network and movement towards motion. i want to see the freeway across the street from my house as if i've never seen it before, and imagine where it might lead. i want to enjoy my morning tea and the company of those i share it with, forgetting that i have to rush off to work when it's done. bantering with the quality humans i am lucky enough to call friends about whether or not i should put 'social justice' on my profile (while baking cookies).  or, i'm battling my bike light as i barhop around oakland, and then hitting up the taco truck, late-night style.  or sleeping. something i should do more of. i shamelessly walk around in my underwear as often as i possibly can. you are self-reflective, goofy, quirky, creatively passionate...  you get excited by breaking down language, want to talk about queerness and privilege and power (but only sometimes...), and being big in the world doesn't scare you.  or if you leave tips at coffee shops."

    "about": "would saying i'm terrible at describing myself be a cop out?  i can be quiet and shy in many situations, odd and a bit goofy in others. i make dumb jokes and never expect laughter from them. i get accused of never talking or not smiling enough, but i think i talk and smile just enough, when the time is right. just trying to find my place. a bit unsure where i'll be heading next. a little bit of everything maybe. i think i'm too self-depreciating for this question. in school i was good at bullshitting papers, at work i'm good at teaching people about technology, in hobbies i'm good at photography, i hope. red hair and possibly the beard, though now that i keep it pretty trim it doesn't really stand out as much, especially with so many beards out there now. music: the beatles, johnny cash, regina spektor, childish gambino, creedence clearwater revival  movies: star wars, pixar movies, high fidelity, a clockwork orange  books: high fidelity, a clockwork orange (see a pattern?). recently the newsflesh trilogy and the wool series have interested me.  shows: community, 30 rock, smash, chuck. working my way through game of thrones and digging it. what's going on around me. i like to people watch, daydream, and wonder what makes people do the things they do. not much. not a partier and i work weekends mostly so friday isn't party day anyway. if i really need to relax i'll pour myself a glass of bourbon and possibly play some video games. i sing in the car."

    "about": "a self summary...well i'm an artist...but not the pretentious type. i draw cartoony, so its fun! i'm good hearted, healthy both physically and mentally. i know what i believe and i know what i want to aspire to. i value my family and friends more than anything, and love a good laugh. most would say i'm silly. yeah, silly. i'm not crazy or crass i just enjoy the simple childlike type of fun that everyone can enjoy. i love good music, good food, and good friends. i'm also currently working at playdom/disney interactive as an artist there, so big thumbs up for what i learned at school cause its paying off! but outside of profession, i'm finishing my degree, working on an animated short film, creating a puppet based web show, singing, drawing, eating great food (i dont settle for bad food), and hanging out with my cat pencil (yeah that's his name). well i draw a lot! so i guess i'm pretty good at that...or at least should be by now. i've sung in many a location. i'm also pretty good at being a total and complete nerd, if the glasses weren't a clue. i have a love and thirst for knowledge, anything involving history (the rise of westren and eastern civ in particular) and a bit of love for astro physics. get talking about space and the universe and string theory and i'm all ears. also i fancy myself at best and intermediate rock climber. well, people notice my looking at them and then quickly glancing down at my sketchbook...cause i'm drawing them. aside from that i think its that i'm generally an overwhelmingly happy guy...or that i'm fairly excitable. like how a 5 year old gets excited about disneyland i get excited about a lot of stuff...but mostly disneyland! aside from that i dont know... i guess my eye brows are pretty distinct... books: picture of dorian grey, the short stories of oscar wilde, out of the silent planet, paralandria, the great divorce, to kill a mockingbird, of mice and men, the jungle book, harry potter, blankets, french milk, lamb: the gospel according to biff jesus' childhood friend, everything is illuminated, series of unfortunate events, the hobbit.  movies: anything pixar, the majority of disney, kingdom of heaven (directors cut), love actually, the village, singing in the rain, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, et, lord of the rings, nacho libre, royal tennanbaums, darjeeling limited, 50 first dates, dan in real life, lars and the real girl, amelie, le vie en rose...and so many more... (i am a movie snob) btw casablanca might be the worlds greatest movie.  food: i love food! all of it! the whole genre! (although i've lost most flavor for chains, i tend to support the local restaurants...that is with the exception of in 'n out.) pencils, paper, friends, family, food, clothes and depending on where i lived a roof to sleep under or a heavy comforter. i think about life mostly...i know thats broad, but seriously. i think about where i'm going in life, how i'm going to get there, what steps i should be taking, who am i going to meet along the way, who am i going to share my life with, what can i be doing now to improve upon myself. typical friday night...i get off the train at 7:30ish call some friends and we usually stay in and hang out, like a group of us. we may go see a movie, grab a drink, make dinner, go to a hooka bar. mostly its pretty laid back and quiet; more focused on our time together than what exactly were doing. i like to think i've got things figured out...but i dont you want to"

    "about": "*sf for the summer*  i moved to austin in july from venice beach, ca to get my mba at ut. having lived in la for 8 years (4 in westwood for ucla and 4 in venice), i am very excited to get to know this new, amazing city. happy hours are exciting for me. in the working world (i worked in music for the past what seems like millions of years) i never got off in time to enjoy them. now that i am in school i have a more unusual schedule which allows me to check them out. i would love to find someone that could show the best ones.  i am very passionate and quite quirky. i regularly get inappropriately dressed up for the occasion. i enjoy someone who i can have witty banter with and can also take charge. entertain me. that is all that it really takes. i am extremely extroverted and enjoy people, but my favorite thing is someone that leads the way confidently and takes me out of my element. going out and getting a little wild is on par for mba students, but i also enjoy having good meals, going to art galleries and spending nights in with friends.  i am in sf for my summer internship before heading back to austin in august. while i am here i am interested in getting to know people and see what happens from there. in san francisco this summer doing my mba summer internship in tech marketing. getting my mba at ut smiling. it's a skill.  being sarcastic. using words outside of their intended meaning. my height, i am a tall lady. the cure, oasis and the kinks. arrested development, showtime, hbo and comedy central i am still trying to incorporate the things i like to do in my free time into my new grad school lifestyle. in my past life i enjoyed going out to meals, art galleries, wine tasting, hiking and trying out new bars (and going out to the same ones). i am still figuring out my favorite places around town, but currently stay around campus, south congress where i live and west 6th. if you have something interesting to say. you are very tall."
