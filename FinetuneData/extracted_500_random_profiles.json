    "essay0": "ahhh, the self-summary. mostly dreaded by all online daters. so many ways to go with this. do i attempt to be funny? keep it practical and serious? sell myself? be a minimalist and hope that my picture is enough?  why don't i start out by saying that i am actually looking for a partner. yes, its true. and yes, it is also true that i like sex. after all, i am guy. but that will have to wait. not being a guy, having sex. you see i have decided that there wont be any more until i am in a committed relationship. so, if you are the rare woman looking for a hook-up, i am not your guy. and if you think commitment is established by date 5, i am still not your guy. \"what\" you say? how can i commit to a relationship with a guy without knowing how good he is in bed? then for sure i am not your guy if that thought is real for you.  kids: its ok if you have one. but i don't have any desire for creating offspring. i am really good with children and have been told repeatedly that i would be a great dad. but, i'm not seeing that for myself. i also like the ability to travel and have the thought of living in more than one place throughout the year. the little ones make that more challenging. but, if you have children and have figured out how to be flexible in that way, i am open to you and yours.  here are some things that help to summarize this guy.  meditator...ideally daily when not drawn off by worldly distractions. vegetarian: 17 years now, would be nice to share that. just makes things easier. india: i have a place there. part of a meditation center. i would say ashram, but that conjures up the wrong image. although there ain't no drinking and smoking going on there. its just one heck of an awesome place to get away to. eckhart tolle: being in the present moment. which for me, for now, means being aware of my attachment to that fabricated thing i call me and thereby letting go of all those thoughts that are continually being fired off by my out of control synapses in my brain. :) would love to, no, let me re-state that, only want to be in a relationship where there is an understanding of who we are and who we are not. if that makes sense to you then nothing more needs to be said. laughter : given the options of talking about anything, it would be silly banter. deep philosophical conversations no longer do it for me. talking about it tends to just get us back in our minds.  now it would not be right of me if i didn't mention some other things that resonate with me. so here goes.  music...dig it. love live music maple infused almond butter....oh yeah naps...seriously 20 minutes and i am good to go outdoors...hiking, biking and camping eating....this guy can cook, but prefers to do it together if possible. that said, i am totally open to having a chef. sex...trying not to like it as much as i do. especially when i am not having any at the current time...being single n all.  one finally thing, i dont currently live in berkeley. i am on the east coast. but i plan on moving out there in october. i will also be out there for a short visit in early august. just sayin'. i am also looking to be bi-coastal as i have some things i will need to attend to here in ct during the late spring summer and fall months.",

    "essay0": "when i was born, the nurses were right to nickname me \"marco polo,\" after the famous traveler. for me, growing up was a constant adventure, letting me live in countries as disparate as norway, saudi arabia, and others. going to college furthered my traveling by taking me to ut-austin, and deciding to go to grad school at stanford led me to my current home, the sf bay area.  when i'm not working, one of my favorite activities is to explore the bay area by biking and hiking. on the weekends, i also sometimes volunteer with second harvest food bank or repair bicycles for kids in need. i think that it's extra meaningful to know that something i do with my own hands is directly changing someone else's life. occasionally, i'm able to combine my hobbies with community service, and one of my proudest achievements is completing a half ironman triathlon, for which i raised over $1200 for cancer charities.  on the more artistic side, most nights when i'm relaxing at home, you'll find me with a guitar in my hands. if i hear a great song, i feel compelled to grab one of my guitars and strum along. recently, i've also taken up dancing, and my favorites are waltz, swing, and salsa. i also enjoy attending musicals and dance performances (some recent favorites are \"avenue q\" and \"burn the floor\").  around the home, i don't think that i'm a talented cook, but i can definitely whip up a simple meal for 2 from scratch in under 25 minutes. every now and then, i'll invite friends over for a meal and board games (current favorites are bang! and dominion) or host a themed potluck like \"japanese\" night (complete with sushi making and karaoke!). i also like organizing group events like ski trips to tahoe or an outing to a cultural festival.  well, those are a few glimpses of who i am, but there's definitely more to discover. if you want to learn more about me, send me a message.",

    "essay0": "hi guys!  let me tell you a little about myself. i'm a woman of many interests and talents - a jack (jill?) of all trades, as they say. i'm an adventurer who enjoys traveling the world and exploring self and spirituality.  i'm health conscious, not fanatical by any means, but i do try to make healthy choices. i buy organic dairy products, choose wheat over white and rarely drink alcohol. i'm vegetarian and have been my whole life. you don't need to be vegetarian, but i prefer someone who is okay not having meat in the house. i know some people might freak out at this. i'd like to recommend reading, \"fast food nation\" and watching the movie, \"food, inc.\" it might change your mind. regardless, you'll definitely learn facts the mainstream media won't share with you.  i workout regularly. i'm a dance fitness instructor. what do i teach? zumba, baby! have you heard of it? it's mostly the latin american (latino / hispanic) dances (salsa, merengue, etc) spiced with other global dances with a fitness twist. it's a big party! my passion is ethnic dancing. i'm always up for attending a dance or theater show.  i love dances from other countries, and i love traveling to other countries too. my parents immigrated from india so i was lucky to have started traveling in my youth. in the last five years i've visited mexico, india, singapore, taiwan, germany, czech republic, poland, hungary...in addition to hawaii and alaska! looking forward to more travel in asia. would love to tour and dance in egypt. an african safari would be wild!  i'm looking for a long-term committed romantic relationship (as in marriage) built on a strong foundation of friendship, trust and respect. the first step in that though is seeing if we enjoy each other's conversation. conversation is the most important thing to me.  if there's anything in my profile that makes you think we could be a match, e-mail me! let's meet and see if we click. i really don't want to spend a lot of time on long e-mail exchanges or even talking on the phone (not looking for a pen pal or phone buddy). i prefer to meet in person. be sure you have photos and some substantial description on your profile.  you know how quickly time flies. let's get off this site and move on to happily ever after!",

    "essay0": "i am a passionate and engaged person looking for joy and meaning in life. i am both a historian of science (with a focus on the history of astrology) and a practicing astrologer. i long for love and connection on all levels, and am definitely an affection hound. cuddling is one of my favorite activities.  that was my first swipe at an ok cupid profile. what follows is take 2:  my okcupid profile, take 2 after a month on the site and a friend's feedback. she primarily said that i should go on at greater length about what i care about and thus reveal some more of my personality. i personally would have it be more concise, but here goes!  first of all, here's my philosophy of relationships:  [1] projection: it takes time to get to know people! at first it's mostly all projections, and how wonderful that can be! then there's the inevitable pulling back of projections through some sort of difficult something, and then you actually begin to start getting to know the actual person. this is often the beginning of the end, but not always (thank goodness).  [2] connection: in my world, there are five relevant areas in which two people can connect: physical, mental, emotional, spiritual and energetic. all are important for a sustainable long-term intimate relationship. but of course there are different types of relationships, and it sometimes takes a while to figure out what the appropriate type is for the two people involved. indeed, there are more and more complications at every turn. so it goes.  so back to the five levels. two people may well connect on one or more, but to have a sustainable long-term intimate relationship, one needs (or at least i do) to connect on all five. a sign of my maturity, of late, is that i no longer believe that 100% connection on all levels is necessary, but i do think 80% or so on at least most of them is.  but of course people change in both the long and the short term.  anyway, without going on too long here, i hope you get the outline at least of what i'm looking for. i really am open to and hoping to find my life's partner, and to spending the rest of our lives exploring intimacy, connection and joy together in all the relevant ways. wouldn't that be lovely! in the meantime, however, i hope to enjoy the process of finding her, however long that takes.  my main motivating factor in life is to penetrate beneath the surface into the juicy heart of things, thereby inspiring and nourishing everyone i come into contact with. in that light, there is this mysterious dimension called sympathy', electricity', chemistry' or simply energetic connection'. you certainly know it when you feel it; at least i do. and of course that also happens (or can happen) on numerous levels simultaneously, thereby also increasing the complexity of coupling. yipes! why can't things be simple? do you suppose god is jewish too? and that klezmer was the original music of the spheres at creation? (the pythagoreans were so square!)  and speaking of complications, although on some level it seems like it might be fun to be polyamorous, in reality, there is only one thing more complicated that being involved with one woman and that's being involved with more than one!  there you have it, a first approach to articulating my philosophy of relationships. but let there be no doubt: i believe in love and its transformative and redemptive powers. truly, madly, deeply!  i hope you do too.",
    "essay1": "the main things i'm doing with my life these days are finishing my book on the history of astrology and looking for love. and trying to do as much good and have as much fun as humanly possible.  i am also doing my part to raise a magnificent almost 18 year old daughter who is my pride and joy, the apple of my eye, and a scorpio like her nice old dad. i have learned so much about life (and women!) from getting to know her over the years. every phase has been more wonderful than the last! what a blessing she is, giving me constant hope and faith in an increasingly crazy world.  fyi though, she lives with her mother, not me.  i am also looking for a patron in lieu of the academic position for which i have been searching, mostly in vain. i have, however, had a splendid run of one year jobs and postdoctoral fellowships that have taken me to, among other places, los angeles (the huntington--paradise on earth!) and new york (nyu), cambridge, ma and norman, ok, florence and rome. ah, italy! i have been very fortunate indeed! somehow, if one follows ones bliss, things have a way of working out.  along those lines, i was deeply inspired at a relatively young age by a book called the last barrier by reshad field. he said that the sufis say that our job in this life is to find out our true name (as it were) and to proclaim it every day in every way for the rest of our lives. marsilio ficino says the same thing in his astounding text, the de vita libri tres, especially in the 3rd book, the famous de vita coelitus comparanda (on deriving life from the heavens). [i can't imagine there is much latin on this site; in that light, i'd like to add two more sayings: fortuna favet audaci, and amor vincit omnia!] finally, and also from the reshad field book, i was blown away in my youth by the quotation--ostensibly from st francis-- that \"what we are looking for is what is looking\"!",
    "essay2": "eating, walking, cuddling, reading, massaging and being affectionate, although not necessarily in that order. i'm also pretty good at reading horoscopes, hint, hint! i'm also really good at listening, and being responsive, as well as being proactive.  i am a great fan of and would very much like to cultivate a regular practice of sacred sensuality/sexuality. in my world, sex and spirit are not in any way irreconcilable.  i'm not particularly good at sitting idly by, or waiting for stuff to happen.  i am also very good at picking produce, both fruits and vegetables.",
    "essay3": "my intense blue eyes and my smile, perhaps also my posture. they probably also notice that i can be wildly flirtatious, although i've done my best in later years to keep this more under my hat. i can't help it; there's nothing i'd rather have on the end of my line of sight that a beautiful inspiring magnificent woman.",
    "essay4": "my favorite novel overall is apuleius's golden ass; the most inspiring work of history i've read is frances yates's giordano bruno and the hermetic tradition. i also love tom robbins and alan watts. let's not forget kurt vonnegut, another scorpio with midwestern tendencies. i've also been inspired by the work of franz kafka, who seems to have understood the fundamental absurdities of life more clearly than most. my favorite is the trial. i fear, however, that i don't read much fiction, considering truth to not only be more interesting, but often more beautiful as well.  another of my favorite books is james hillman's brilliant and provocative revisioning psychology.  i also love alan watts's books, including his beautifully titled autobiography: \"in my own way.\" in it, he said that his main goals in life were to \"screw the inscrutable and eff the ineffable.\" i couldn't agree more!  my favorite movies are wings of desire and the wizard of oz. that said, i love cinema of many varieties. i lived in new york last year. one of the best parts about being there was becoming a member of moma, which allowed me access to their amazing film program, where, among other things, i saw the opening of winter's bone, with the director and a number of the actors. what an amazing film.  the best thing i've seen lately though is 'the disappearance of alice creed.' truly brilliant, however disturbing.  and of course i'm a great lover of italian cinema, especially fellini, and within his ouvre, the satyricon.  i love a broad range of music. my favorite bands are u2, bruce springsteen, the doors, and more recently dave matthews and the red hot chili peppers. i also love stravinsky's rites of spring and anything by chet baker. i also love a range of world music, both to listen and dance to, from king sunny ade to boca do rio to bunny wailer.  i shouldn't forget peter gabriel and king crimson from the '80s. living in austin in the '80s was a sublime experience. i crave sublime experiences, not to mention a little ecstasy every now and again (not the drug!).  and i just saw linda tillery in berkeley. they were amazing!  hardly, strictly bluegrass was wonderful. i saw five great acts: trombone shorty, the carolina chocolate drops, doc watson (i hope my groove is still working so well at 87!), nick lowe, and the magnificent sharon jones and the dap kings. what a blast!  concerning food, there is a broad range, once again, but i'm completely smitten these days with an indian buffet joint on 9th avenue. i really do love a broad range of cuisines. one of my favorite newish restaurants is a middle eastern place called jannah. it's affordable and delicious, and the owner is a peach of a man. i got spoiled on middle eastern food while living in pasadena though, in particular armenian food. mm, mm. i also have a taste for polish food, but i won't go any further into that now. and also good old jewish deli. living on the upper west side last year with easy access to murray's and to tal's bagels made my experience there all the more memorable.  my sister is one of the great foodie's of all time. she too lives in sf and always has a memorable restaurant to recommend.",

[more latin, sorry!]  as you can probably tell by now, i am a disappointed optimist, a curmudgeon (one of my favorite words!) with a tender heart. nothing makes me happier than to be inspired by my fellow human beings!",

    "essay0": "i love reading the new york times with a strong cup of coffee and riding my motorcycle through beautiful bay area back country. n.b. i do not ride a harley or a racing-type super bike, i do not wear those dopey leather outfits, and i definitely do not hang out with pretentious, deeply insecure bikers. i love to travel, but who doesn't? the last country i visited was croatia and one of the most beautiful and interesting places i have ever been is south africa. i graduated from an ivy league university in new jersey with a degree in electrical engineering and computer science. a female friend once told me: \"you are into knowledge.\" i grew up in los angeles, went to school back east, and have now lived in the bay area for over 20 years. i take great satisfaction in my work and i am professionally accomplished. in my twenties, i wrote groundbreaking software and founded a successful internet-based consumer service which is now a branded division of a well known public company. in my thirties, i opened and ran a critically acclaimed restaurant. in my forties, i am back in the tech world starting a company from scratch for the third time in my life - standard disclaimer here about striving to achieve life/work balance. i also like to crack absurd jokes and laugh frequently, but fundamentally, i have the mind of an engineer/scientist. you might like me if your father was an engineer or a scientist. i say that because i operate with a degree of mental precision which doesn't mesh with some personality styles. more specifically, if you are histrionic, new agey, an artiste, you tend to think or speak in vagaries, get easily confused, change your mind a lot, or watch dumb tv shows like american idol or survivor, we will not hit it off for more than a few minutes of polite conversation.",

    "essay2": "listening & observing i think this comes from being an artist/designer...these things are part of my dna. you learn so much about people from stepping back and watching how we interact with each other. fascinating! a lot of my friends and family see me as a confidante, and value my opinions and that i genuinely listen and genuinely care (this seems to be rare, which is sad). i am not gossipy and i am loyal, and i tend to be able to make people laugh when they need it most.  cooking i love to cook, and am pretty darn good at it. for me cooking can be like a mini vacation. whether i'm making coq au vin, paella, or something like a moroccan spiced chicken, i love a good culinary adventure and think food can be a small insight into other cultures. i'm a good baker, too, and make a mean chocolate chip cookie. if i like you enough i'll tell you my secret ingredient. ;-) my vice is ice cream, which i don't actually make (why make it when you can buy things like ben & jerry's what a cluster).",
    "essay3": "this seemed an odd one to answer about myself, so i cheated and took an informal poll of my friends. they said: your warm friendly smile your long blond hair and light blue eyes you seem easy-breezy and have a cool demeanor smile, goldy locks, cheery, friendly to strangers, good with kids, childlike enthusiasm cries easily at sappy movies, blushes easily at the slightest compliments, laughs easily at the silliest jokes first one to the monkey bars when recess is called (and sometimes before) and the last one to leave your beautiful hair, and how when you smile, your eyes smile too people magnet your sense of style how hilariously funny you are. this always lifts my mood! how comfortable you make those around you, even those who have never met you  don't i have great friends? and they're right about one thing, for sure: i am blushing.",
    "essay4": "i could read anything by kurt vonnegut or david sedaris over and over again and never get bored. i've also downloaded one of those required reading lists for school, and my goal is to get to all the ones that weren't required at my school.  i love watching movies, particularly independent movies and documentaries, but i think it's great fun to see the bigger budget ones on the big screen as well (and come oscar time, i like to make my picks on a ballot at home and see how i do. this year i kicked ass). last year i loved the artist, beginners, and hugo. i'm not a movie snob, though, and i admittedly have some questionable taste at times. my guilty pleasures--the ones i never seem to tire of--are: tangled, princess bride, roman holiday, international velvet (no, not the classic movie with elizabeth taylor and mickey rooney. the one with tatum o'neal. i know, i know. and yes, i have watched it recently) and up.  i don't own a tv (and i mean that in the least possible holier-than-thou way imaginable). it's just not a priority in my life and took up too much space. i do have hulu, itunes and the internet, though, so i find pretty much anything i want to watch that way. arrested development, the office and the daily show never get old. i'm also painfully addicted to downton abbey. i may have been the last one aboard that train, but it is all i can do to make it last. currently just over halfway through season two and doing everything i can to stretch it out (one per week. one per week. one per week), i can't believe i have to wait until next year for season 3. oh, mr. bates, what just happened with your ex?! i don't want to know. no, i do. i think. argh! and matthew! what was that? did you feel something? tell me!!!  music is a huge part of my life and it is almost always on at work or home. i have really eclectic tastes and my itunes library on shuffle sounds a bit schizophrenic. it might go from 70's rock ballads (i just bought the best of bread and captain & tennille) to 80's brit pop to hall & oates (don't even try to tell me you don't like them), to musicals, classical and operas, to current favorites like amos lee, alison kraus and cu.  i have a sort of when in rome attitude about food, and i like to eat what the locals eat and to try new cuisines. i draw the line at organ meats, but have eaten blood pudding, frog legs, pigs feet, cow tongue and lots of other bizarro things. i did go through a vegetarian phase when i was younger (i was lured back to meat by a perfectly prepared pork tenderloin...the gateway meat!), and i still eat a pretty heavily veggie-based diet. i just try to eat a healthy and balanced diet.",
    "essay5": "art & music ben & jerry's what a cluster. or maybe dublin mudslide. can i have both? my passport dark chocolate my sketchbook and pencils my family & friends.

(is that a diagnosis of a 2% self destructive streak then?)  why does this thing think i'm less spiritual? just because i didn't answer yeah to something about jesus, again? not a fan of the zombie gods. why are those questions even on here? don't they know only heathens use the internet? christians are in church praying for my soul. i'm reading suzuki on zen, again. i'm friggin' soulful, maybe a little sour on organized religion, but i appreciate the breeze moving a field of wildflowers, the sound of water on rock, the buzz-on of a healthy gin-on, feet cold without metaphor, and the essence of the now more than then, always more than most. can i throw a glass into the fireplace? yes, i can. so said sammy davis, jr.  stronger inside than outside. and in reverse, smarter outside than inside. stranger inside than outside, and in reverse familiar more outside than inside.

    "essay0": "so, preferring depth to breadth, here are four stories.....  i'm half french- on my mom's side. in france there is a widely held suspicion that belgians are a bit dim. as i wasn't raised bilingually, when i go to france i find myself regularly speaking with completely incorrect grammar but with no trace of an accent. so in the midst of asking questions like \"how much costs one comma five kilograms of cheese\" or \"where i can garage my car\" with the accent of a native speaker... i seem to consistently give the impression that i'm either semi-retarded or possibly visiting from belgium. my family there, at least, knows better (or should). i sometimes have difficulty expressing what's inside, but i enjoy (and keep) trying.  i've always had a strong aesthetic sense and balk at the notion, conveyed in shows like \"queer eye\", that straight men are somehow incapable of dressing, designing, or laying out living spaces for themselves (though cooking for myself is an ongoing project). a year ago i took a pottery class as a fluke and fell in love. pottery has become a minor obsession. i love the embodied-ness of pottery- the way in roots me right there- and the few simple design decisions involved... form, function, color. lately i've gotten into an old-school japanese form of glazing called raku. the technique is one part teamwork, one part pyromania, and one part christmas morning- digging pots out of piles of incinerated newspaper-lined trash cans and cleaning them off. the result is an organic cracked, fractured look that can directly express the beauty of imperfection. (speaking of imperfection, i also love to play acoustic guitar and sing... modestly outdated folks like ben harper, dave matthews, and john mayer. i need to find someone with whom to harmonize... as it were.)  three years ago, during some time off, i decided i would really love to have a dog and it was go time. one evening i happened to catch two tv shows about dogs- pbs specials. having just been immersed in all things canine, i went to sleep. i woke up the next morning with the name molly in my head. without any context or explanation, i immediately put the dream out of my mind. six weeks later, after several regular trips to the local dog shelter, i arrived in the morning and saw what seemed to be the ideal candidate.... a mid-sized, calm girl- supremely, almost impossibly sweet. when i asked the supervisor, whom i'd gotten to know well, about the dog, she told me excitedly that she'd just arrived and was the perfect pet for me. she told me her name was molly. i remembered in a flash and snatched her up. she's great. i'm still opening to trusting the emotional and intuitive parts of myself and learning to give this side its substantial due.  i've been teaching and practicing internal medicine for about ten years at an academic hospital in palo alto (a younger still unshaven version of house sans the narcotic addiction). my passion for medicine and education has been shifting for some time, and i'm seriously considering an additional vocation involving trans-personal/depth psychology. the process of investigating what's true for me and how that effects how i relate, know, and feel- and watching that evolve in others- holds a lot of energy for me. how western medicine and eastern psychology might coalesce into one gestalt is still a mystery.",
