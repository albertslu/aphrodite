(2) in my off-hours i read, exercise, converse, study, garden, meditate, do arty things, and plan lots of projects that i only sometimes start and almost never finish. (3) i own three chess sets, but don't play chess.

(5) i am deeply offended by bad art, and i'm not sure why. (6) i am not above eating an entire plate of kale and then going to smoke a cigarette. (7) i can yawn without moving my face. (8) i have a contradictory blend of intense compassion and utter self-absorption. (9) i enjoy silence, but not in elevators. (10) i have been a beginning yoga student for 8 years. (11) i can never seem to stand up straight, but when i do: watch out. my height has been described by some as \"gangly\" and others as \"elven\", which to me are two very different things. i have also been told i resemble a \"bundle of sticks.\" (12) my best friend once told me that if i turned out to be a figment of her imagination she wouldn't be surprised, which we agreed was both an enormous compliment and a colossal insult. (13) my pet peeves include people who make noise in movie theaters, a lopsided pasta/sauce ratio, and those who take a really long time in single-occupancy public restrooms even though they know others are waiting because the door handle has jiggled like seven times. also, i think people who feel they're too good to bag their own groceries are disgusting.

{"prompt": "Hoping to find a 25 year-old m who is creative and curvy.", "completion": "i'm new to sf from boston and thought this might be a good way to meet some new people.  instead of writing about me i think it would be better if i told you what i am looking for,  while i am always down to meet new friends, i know what i want in a girl, and i don't want to waste your time.  you enjoy ordering something different everytime you go out to a restaurant, and speaking of restaurants, offering to split the check on the first date tells a lot more about a person than someone who assumes its taken care of, even though i will never let you do that.  i am tall. i like tall girls. 5'6\" to 6'2 is the sexy sweet zone.  if you can ski or snowboard and know what state jackson hole is in you pretty much beat everyone out. i'll date a non skier but don;t expect me to hang out with you on a powder day.  adventures are fun, but so is being lazy. i like doing new things, just not all the time.  my mother taught me how to cook, which she is great at, i will at some point make you cook with me. its ok if you don't know how. its not ok if you don't try.  dr. pepper is the best soda, don't hate if you can't appreciate.  owning a gym membership is a good thing.  no hiding secret talents, if you can do amazing things i want to see it.  people who use the number 3 instead of the e are stupid.  and most importantly, you are not dateable if you sleep with someone on the first night."}
