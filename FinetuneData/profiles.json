        "description": "about me:  i would love to think that i was some some kind of intellectual: either the dumbest smart guy, or the smartest dumb guy. can't say i can tell the difference. i love to talk about ideas and concepts. i forge odd metaphors instead of reciting cliches. like the simularities between a friend of mine's house and an underwater salt mine. my favorite word is salt by the way (weird choice i know). to me most things in life are better as metaphors. i seek to make myself a little better everyday, in some productively lazy way. got tired of tying my shoes. considered hiring a five year old, but would probably have to tie both of our shoes... decided to only wear leather shoes dress shoes.  about you:  you love to have really serious, really deep conversations about really silly stuff. you have to be willing to snap me out of a light hearted rant with a kiss. you don't have to be funny, but you have to be able to make me laugh. you should be able to bend spoons with your mind, and telepathically make me smile while i am still at work. you should love life, and be cool with just letting the wind blow. extra points for reading all this and guessing my favorite video game (no hints given yet). and lastly you have a good attention span."

        "description": "i'm not ashamed of much, but writing public text on an online dating site makes me pleasantly uncomfortable. i'll try to be as earnest as possible in the noble endeavor of standing naked before the world.  i've lived in san francisco for 15 years, and both love it and find myself frustrated with its deficits. lots of great friends and acquaintances (which increases my apprehension to put anything on this site), but i'm feeling like meeting some new people that aren't just friends of friends. it's okay if you are a friend of a friend too. chances are, if you make it through the complex filtering process of multiple choice questions, lifestyle statistics, photo scanning, and these indulgent blurbs of text without moving quickly on to another search result, you are probably already a cultural peer and at most 2 people removed. at first, i thought i should say as little as possible here to avoid you, but that seems silly.  as far as culture goes, i'm definitely more on the weird side of the spectrum, but i don't exactly wear it on my sleeve. once you get me talking, it will probably become increasingly apparent that while i'd like to think of myself as just like everybody else (and by some definition i certainly am), most people don't see me that way. that's fine with me. most of the people i find myself gravitating towards are pretty weird themselves. you probably are too."
