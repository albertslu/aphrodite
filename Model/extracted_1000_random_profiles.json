(takeshi's castle/mxc, zatichi, battle royale) - \"amalie\". so much fun. - \"office space\". pretty sure i've lived this movie. - \"a room in rome\". you can make of that what you will, but i thought it was amazing. - \"lost in translation\". bill murray is a damn fine actor, and this was a damn fine movie for him. - recent: \"a cabin in the woods\", \"the hunger games, \"the avengers\", \"the secret world of arrietty\", \"the dictator\". (i'm all over the place, but have a soft spot for imports and smaller-budget independent films. subtitles do not bother me in the slightest, but bad dubs are like nails on a chalkboard.)  music - no country or misogynistic hip-hop; anything else goes. - love electronic stuff; progressive, trance. dig deadmau5, the prodigy, bassnectar, madeon, the glitch mob, the crystal method, justice. will listen to drum and bass if i've had too much red bull. - also industrial-ish stuff; nin, tool, etc. \"vicarious\" is seven minutes of brain melting goodnes. - love weird stuff; beardyman and thepetebox amaze me. tmbg and jonathan coulton are too much fun. flight of the conchords, an important part of a healthy musical diet. and if you've never heard of moxy frvous, go to youtube right now and search for them. it's okay. i'll wait. - best \"big\" concert i've attended so far: nine inch nails in chicago, during their \"fragile\" tour. reznor owned the stage. - i think johnny cash's cover of \"hurt\" was dramatically better than the original. really, cash can do no wrong, musically. - best \"small\" concert: john popper (lead singer for blues traveler) doing a surprise small event in a seedy little place in chicago. that man has a relationship with his harmonicas that i could only hope to have with another human being. - most interesting concert:  (kiosk), an iranian folk/rock band that played recently in san francisco. didn't understand a word of it, and didn't care. their cover of sultans of swing as a finale was awesome.  shows - \"too much light makes the baby go blind\", by a sketch troup called the neo-futurists. the tagline is \"30 plays in 60 minutes\"; it's a lightning round of awesome. - want to see the book of mormon. very. badly.  oh, you meant tv shows? meh, i'm not much of a tv person. i like the walking dead, even though i think it moves pretty glacially. i watch house regularly, and love the daily show (and colbert, but his brand of humor grates on me a bit). i'm happy to kick back on the couch and watch a show, but i'd usually rather watch a movie. convince me i'm wrong? :)  food san francisco is doing terrible things to my waistline; the food here is amazing, and i'm having a ton of fun discovering new things to try. i'd never been able to put \"good eating\" and vegetarian or vegan cuisine together before, but while i'll likely never give up meat, i can dine very well here with friends who choose not to partake. indian, thai, and vietnamese are what i'm currently hooked on (and i'm always up for sushi), but really, i'll try almost anything at least once.",

'hot' comes in many shapes, colors, ages, and sizes. attitude and self confidence are paramount.  i do not believe in non-platonic, healthy relationships without both parties being sexually satisfied. mutual physical attraction and clear communication are musts.  interested in developing (a) healthy, positive relationship(s). open to what is brought to the table and believe in considerateness about individual needs and boundaries. basically, i'm not into forcing anything. i am not relationship/commitment-phobic, but will not deny positive, enriching experiences because of agendas or relationship goals.  as i travel for work regularly, i appreciate that my schedule is not ideal for those who are searching for someone to spend the vast majority of their time with. if you are not busy, professionally and/or personally, my calendar may prove to be problematic. i have no \"set schedule\". sometimes i am free for days or weeks on-end. at times, i am zig-zagging across timezones with only brief stops home. sometimes i'm gone for 2 weeks at a time. most of my travels are not booked last-minute. meaning yes, i can make plans, and stick to them. i hope you have a rich personal/social life that demands your attention, in a good way. i do. let's share.  i live optimistically. i believe in living with kindness and consideration with a clear conscience. we can always learn from our experiences. i would rather fall on my face continually, if always experiencing with honesty while living life conscientiously, than not experiencing at all. with this caveat considered, i believe in living without regrets.  i am comfortable in any situation, be it social or professional settings. always mindful of the those around me and considerate of people's emotions. i try not to be assumptive, but regularly act upon my gut feelings. i have been told i have great intuition. i just like to think i give a fuck.  i enjoy the good things in life. i am a sensualist. when it comes to having fun, i'm not at all afraid to let my hair down (so to speak). at heart, i am a hedonist in the dionysian sense.  liars, manipulators, haters, homophobes, and thieves need not apply.",

    "essay0": "/*bear with me; this whole profile will change as i find the time. i'm not the worlds fastest writer. */  answer to jacob  like most things in life it started with a pair of ducks. a family of mallards has taken up residence where i work. they follow each other throughout the day. swimming in the fountain and roosting in the park nearby.  their choice of location affords them a great deal of leisure time, which to a duck means staring blankly into space. still, the ducks understand one thing, whatever you are doing it is better to do it as a flock. a raven or fox might see things differently, but ducks have never been much for the individual.  in fact it is pointless to tell them apart, once you have met one duck you have met them all. the whole quacking flock of them hatch ducks, live ducks and die ducks.  ducks are not so different from the man who was sitting across from me. he could have been anyone in his casual business garb. he fit in with the other well dressed professionals in the cafe. i went to high school with him. now ten years later, a little heaver, and a little balder we are eating lunch together. he asks me if i still write poetry, i tell him no. he shakes his head, he doesn't either.  the conversation started with a decade's history, baby pictures, remembrances of old friends, but soon he started talking about what was really on his mind.  he has an idea of life and love as a progressive enterprise, one block built on another, education, career, wife, family, each part in support of the next. now he finds the bridge dissolving behind him. married with two small children in the house, he turned 30 and thought \"what about me?\" he and his wife were never prepared to face the reality of forever. now, at 30, he fears that his life might be over.  the blessing and the curse of our oversize brains is our diversity and adaptability. jacob has a house, two young girls and a wife. he followed the established path to hearth and home and panicked when he realized that he had no more mountains to climb. he wanted more, and that hole would not be filled by skydiving or a sports car. his blueprints for a fulfilled life ended mid span and now he does not know where to turn.  this is what got me thinking about the ducks. we humans are the only creatures who are born without fixed identities. small children are predictable, but at some point a human child will become like no other child on earth. jacob and his wife got married and had children because it's what our species does. just as ducks migrate every year. his life plan was as much a path of instinct and conditioning as a conscious goal.  a duck is merely a duck, but jacob is not ready to be merely a husband. he remains the ambitious man i knew in school, his circumstances have changed, but he has not. his wife achieved her goal with the birth of their children and turned her attention inward, he feels like her marriage to him was a step to the goal of having children; not the step to the partnership he had envisioned. he tells me: \"she's changed.\" \"you haven't?\" i ask him. \"i just want... you know...\" and i do know.  i almost married once; i wanted it to work in spite of everything, to hold the ship together, like it was the most critical thing in the world. and as i lay in bed beside her, i have never felt so lonely. i understand, but there is nothing i can do except listen. love is not a choice, it is an act of faith. his wife married for children, he married for companionship. one does not exclude the other. this whole conversation struck me as perverse. jacob has a family, a house and a job, and he is unhappy. what do you say to a man who has everything?  it got me thinking about my own place in the world. you see, ducks don't ask questions about this kind of thing, no other animal does. most people don't either. i don't share jacob's view of marriage as a stepping stone, or that it is the best solution for everyone. in fact his marriage may be more for his children s benefit then his own.  i wish i could tell you how it ends. but i don't know what to say to jacob, or anyone else who finds the ground shifting beneath their feet. bridges that survive learn to flex in the wind and tide; anything made too stiff will be broken by the world. its easy to sit back and just tell him to love his wife, or communicate more. the reality is i don't know the real story, not nearly.  jacob and i finished our meal and walked awkwardly to the parking lot. i steered the conversation to our childhoods and our common misadventures.  as i walked home i thought about how we became childhood friends. when we are children our friendships are a matter of proximity, all children share a common fundamental experience of growing up. making friends was easy, we were all sixth graders. some of us retained this habit into adulthood. mistaking proximity for intimacy we fell in love with the person closest to us. attraction fades, the years grind you down; in the end i am left asking the question i should have asked at the start. \"is she here with me, or do we happen to be in the same place at the same time?\"  on my way home i stopped by the park and sat down next to a sunbathing mallard pair. \" how do you do it?\" i asked them. \"love is not sitting still in the lake together\" quacked the male. \"it is flying in the same direction\" quacked the female. and then the waddled into the reeds to leave me alone with my thoughts.  fin when we are children our friendships are a matter of proximity, all children share a common fundamental experience of growing up. some of us retain this habit into adulthood. the person he fell into bed with was the person he married. the shared experience of the past was enough to make a future, regardless of the underlying personality of the two people involved. of course two people will perceive events differently and if communication is not flowing freely the paths that met at a point will diverge. two lines running in parallel will be closer then two lines that touch.  it is the moments between that define a person, not the big decision, but the millions of small steps that reached that point. when we look at the footprints the path becomes clear.  the trouble with viewing relationships as achievements is that they must be maintained. a marriage license can't be hung on a wall and forgotten like a award or degree. the car you never drive dies faster then the one you take to work.  see a pair of woman walking their dogs along the path near where i work. they come out together holding a leash with one hand their partners hand in the other. they look happy, i see them almost every morning walking together i wonder what they were told when they were kids, who they thought they would end up with and what they left behind to find happiness in each other. i hope i have the courage to be that bold.  marriage as a means to an end.  a common cry of the young is that they are unique in some way. i won't argue weather this is true or false, but i am old enough to understand that the more unique you are in the world the more alone you are. like ducks we are creatures of the flock. our happiness and survival depend on each other. a person who was truly unique would have nothing in common with anyone. no music to share, no books to discuss. it's funny to watch a 'counter culture' become more homogeneous then the culture it protests.  after: i remember a book jacob and i read in our english class a dozen years ago. so, when i return from lunch i write the word 'why?' on a sticky note and put it above the office door. my co-worker asks me \"why not?\" so i tell him the story i just told you. he didn't get the joke. the note was gone the next day.  also why is every fifth question about gay marriage and nobody thought to check if i'm a vegan. i'm a omnivoredammit; didn't anyone think that this might be a bad match? i'm looking for friends and relations, not running for office.  chemistry. are the ties that bind covalent or ionic? are you a metal or a gas, noble or reactive, how important are your electrons to you?

(sociology) the science of leonardo (pop science) court of the red tzar. under the banner of heaven. moral minds.  many of the books that changed my life when i was younger don't stand up so well years later. some books just come along at the right time. back when i was in high school i devoured everything that stephen r. donaldson wrote.  magazine subscriptions; new scientist skeptic.  even if i don't find a  here, i'm discovering all kinds of new and interesting books from peoples profiles. that alone makes it worthwhile. much better then the amazon recommendations; thank you one and all.",

    "essay9": "if any of this sounds familiar to you.  if you have a story to tell.  if you are uncomfortable in your own skin.  if you know a good open writers group in the bay area.  i often forget i'm logged in so i might miss your im. send me short note over email, i will write you back, whoever you are."

    "essay3": "most of the time my eyes, though i've gotten comments about having really soft hair before, from both partners and complete strangers. that is assuming people notice me at first, obviously. i tend to not intentionally stand out in a crowd.  outside appearances, though, i'm pretty sure people notice a playful and friendly nature. just gotta break through that outer shell a little bit.",
    "essay4": "books i don't really pick up that much anymore, though if i do get my hands on one, it's more than likely sci-fi or fantasy fiction. i like to get lost in the deep stories that many games now are developed in, like the mass effect universe or warcraft. yes i do play world of warcraft. someone's gotta kill those internet dragons.  movies i've spent less and less time watching lately, between the cost of going to the movies and my opinion that stories in movies have grown vastly inferior to that of video games now. i'd rather spend my time playing through an engrossing video game story that keeps me hanging on for days or weeks rather than a movie that only keeps me entertained for an hour or so. though star wars (episodes 2-6) still holds a special place. there was no episode 1.  music for me is wide open. i grew up surrounded by funk and 70's music, classic rock, and soul that my parents listened to in the car. my musical tastes have very few boundaries, and again i have video games to thank for that. it really started when i got hooked on ddr back in high school (which i totally kicked ass at, by the way), and i started to expand my musical interests thanks to what i heard in the games. the same thing happened more with games like guitar hero and rock band. if i had to narrow down what i listen to most, it would probably be rock music, with various dance and electronic following that. the only genre i won't touch is country. i hate country music. don't know why really, i just can't stand it.  ah, food. what's not to love? aside from certain greenish vegetables that still make me want to puke, i'll eat anything once. sushi? sure. mexican? love to. italian? my home turf. indian? i love some spicy stuff. i'd love going out to new restaurants more often. just don't ask me to decide on what to eat, i'm terrible when it comes to making up my mind about food.",

    "essay7": "probably some form of gaming, if i'm not already trying to catch up on sleep from the week (getting up at 4:30am is not my nature, but work demands it). every once in a while i may go to a local concert, but i stay away from bars. i'd rather not go someplace dark and packed solely to drink: drinking should be a complementary activity with things like board games.",
    "essay8": "i used to want to be a meteorologist when i was a kid. my classmates in elementary school always asked me to do weather reports before lunchtime."

awesome. day watch? less awesome. wanted? even less awesome. i'll be seeing it at a private screening with an open bar and 200 friends of friends, so it'll probably be the best movie i see all year!  tv shows: ok i'm actually going to make a list here: doctor who, star trek, misfits (uk, seriously, go watch it), community, the it crowd, archer, metalocalypse, the venture brothers, flight of the conchords (this belongs under music, too), samurai jack, firefly, game of thrones, the walking dead (i probably tolerated the first half of the 2nd season better because i'd read the books, because yeah it was sooooo slow) i have a lot of shows in my netflix/hulu queues to catch up on, some day, such as lost, breaking bad, being human, etc.  music: i have a last.fm profile, soooo, some of the dominant tags are: electronic, industrial, metal, indie, rock, house, dance, bluegrass, etc. here's a mix of top artists, recent and all time: dethklok, david guetta, the black dahlia murder, ministry, misfits, the devil makes three, einstrzende neubauten, skinny puppy, depeche mode, franz ferdinand, anything justin broadrick is involved with (godflesh, jesu). the limousines' \"get sharp\" was probably my favorite album of 2010 (i haven't decided for 2011 yet). i'm also quite pleased to see m83 bringing back the sexy sax solo. if something makes me want to dance i will probably like it a lot, i am a simple woman. going to see hank iii was probably the most rednecked show i never even thought possible, but was still pretty awesome. one of my coworkers recently said something to me that i find really amusing: he's really surprised that i like the aggressive music i do because based on my demeanor (being one of the calmest & most level-headed people he knows) i should be into something like norah jones  which i decidedly am not. i'm also going to austin city limits this year (my sister connived me into it...), because i do actually like music that isn't metal; the black keys, florence + the machine, iggy & the stooges, m83, crystal castles, metric, childish gambino, and some bluegrass bands i love will be there, so it seems worth it (plus i get to see her dog again, who's basically one of the best & cutest ever - border collies ber alles). beethoven's 7th symphony in a major never ceases to make me weep.  food: all of it. all the food. i love it. as long as it doesn't come from an animal. since i am not hiding my veganism in this profile, i just want to state that i despise the sanctimonious hipster vegan stereotype. i am a serious exception to it. most people don't even know i'm a vegan unless we go out to eat and they observe me ordering. i'm smart enough to know that a dietary decision like this is intensely personal and that people resent being proselytized to (including myself). this is what works for me, but i am not going to try to convert you. that said, this is something about me that will never change as i can now say i've been a vegan for over half my life; i even have a tattoo commemorating my first 15 years as a vegan (i love love love it, my artist is awesome). back on the topic of favorite types of food, i am definitely an adventurous eater. i really cannot understand it when people won't try new food because it's weird or different. i'm always up for ethiopian. thai & mediterranean/middle eastern are up there, as well. just keep raw red onions out of the picture and we can still be friends.",

(if you reject evolution and don't think we share a common ancestor with other life on the planet, we won't get along. creationism is a pile of nonsense.)  non-paleobiology. you know that thing that happens when you watch a small kitten playing intently and it's so cute your brain can't process it? i get that with cuttlefish.  disneyland and walt disney world. they're deeply weird and endlessly fascinating. they're basically giant pieces of art, coupled with social manipulation, and the art is often at odds with the goals of corporate disney. if you want to learn about american culture, one of the best things you can do is visit wdw.  scuba diving. i'm pretty new - i got certified last july - and i desperately want to do more. i feel privileged to live close enough to dive in monterey, with its sunlit kelp forests and riotously dense marine life.  i'm poly and dating the excessively cool starchy.",
