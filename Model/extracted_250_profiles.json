    "essay0": "to start with a random thought... just imagine if everyday, everywhere we go we all had to wear little signs with this type of info. yep, you know it, oneday soon there'll be an app for that - *shudder*  everybody says \"aargh! i hate this part.\" so i may as well join the club. argh!... ok done. actully i like myself enough that i don't mind talking about me, myself & i when appropriate. it would delight me to skip the laundry list of adjectives and attributes, and leave you curious, with a little mystery, or just say 'i'm great', but i think that would be a cop out. besides, one must bait the hook if one wishes to interest the fish, and i know i'm no robert redford/brad pitt analog. the following may be a bit long, but hopefully it is interesting, or amusing, or at the very least not boring.  at the moment: currently i am enganged in building raised beds for a new vegetable and herb garden. tons of fun!  the good:  my training and education are in history, but i work as a director in software development, so i have a pretty broad scope from technical to social.  i have a quirky sense of humor, e.g. dying easter eggs on the inside, instead of the outside. i laugh openly over things like this when i read them: the trouble with having an open mind, of course, is that people will insist on coming along and trying to put things in it. (t. pratchett) two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and i'm not sure about the universe.(a. einstein)  openly romantic, i love holding hands, giving flowers, and cuddling anywhere. bambi made me cry (i was 7), and full moons make me smile.  non-clingy, i'll give you room to breathe and do your thing. everyone needs their own space, me included.  reliable, i hate being late and wasting other people's time. i'll always be there when a friend needs me 24/7, even if it means moving a king size bed, to a fifth floor apartment, at midnight, with no elevator.  faithful, i won't cheat on anyone, ever. (don't ask me about poker, craps, or monopoly). i define cheating as violating explicit rather than implicit agreements/limits. we are all adults here (i hope). we all can be and should be clear with each other about our expectations.  honest, sometimes when it would be best to keep my mouth shut. e.g. \"yes, those shorts do make your **** look bigger.\"  easy going, a night in for tv, dvd or games, or a night on the town dining, dancing, or bar diving make me equally happy.  i am a homebody that loves going out on the town.  i love great food (who doesn't?), and i love it when people introduce me to their favorite dishes and cuisines. however, a good hot dog with mustard and onions can be my bliss.  i love to cook... for other people, but only occasionally for myself. i am a successful gastronomic experimenter, but i can follow a recipe.  wine is ok, but i prefer good single malt. i drink rarely, and very rarely get more than buzzed.  6' 0\" yep pretty much on the button ~ i know some guys exaggerate, but i am really and truly six feet not 5' 10\" and a bit.  the bad:  sarcasm is my close friend.  i tend to think in double entendres.  obstinate, stubborn, and pig-headed are my nicknames.  my tongue has been classified as a blunt object, and yet has been known to move faster than light (or at least faster than thought).  all things steampunk amuse, distract, and intrigue me.  i've never been to burning man, although i know a few who have.  it reads as 'overweight' because there is not an option for stocky, or solid with padding, and curvy just sounds wrong for a guy. cuddly might be apt.  my musical tastes are very eclectic, bordering on erratic: from classical to heavy metal, sousa to country, i'll listen to almost anything. (yes, i said sousa as in john phillip, but i'll wear earphones)  the ugly:  outspoken, is something i rarely am by anyone.  i have no patience for fakes, frauds, and false people. i know we all puff up when we first meet people, and i know that we all do the dating disco to show our best side, but there are limits.  i just quit smoking a 6 months ago. i'm trying the e-cig things to transition to a non-nicotine state. so far they are working very well.  i'm a nerd in the best sense of the word, but i do subside into outright uber-nerdom sometimes. e.g. i collect technic lego. i won't drag you into any of my nerdiness unless you want to go.  tv is my default if i'm alone and get bored, or i'm low on energy, but i'd rather do most anything else if i have someone with me.  hobbies:  reading, mostly fiction, mostly sci-fi, but i'll read all things prachett. philosophy, political theory, and history are occasional vices, but i won't inflict them on you unless you ask.  i love to hike, in the woods, through the desert, and over the mountains.  i have been known to ride dirt-bikes on occasion.  gardening and plant shopping do fill the odd weekend.  writing bad poetry. (i like limericks)  sailing, when i have time and access. trivia, all sorts, all the time.  writing fiction, all types, even some work on an amateur graphic novel. (oh... and penning the occasional 'poem')  painting, great for those long rainy days  all board games, the more complicated the better (i am a recovering role playing gamer)  i love classic movies. tcm is my default channel.  about you:  you have a deep and wide curiosity.  you like to try new things, but are comfortable with the old.  you can take a joke, and give a joke, and not be offended by the mildly naughty or wicked.  you believe that wit and passion are essential.  you are willing to be happy.  i'm open as to the rest.  looking for: 90% of everything is better when shared. so, i'm looking for someone with whom to make the most of life. the most of it right now, and perhaps the most of it for quite some time. someone to help me spend time, and with whom i can have fun, and play, and explore, and devise adventures. it would be fantastic if that friendship grows into a deeper relationship. but casual works just fine for now. no i do not mean one night stands, or a parade of booty calls. i mean a relaxed, low pressure process. a strong, loving relationship almost always starts with friendship and play. love at first sight may be great at first blush, but it usually burns out in the harsh light of time. i'm looking for passion and interest, not just palpitations. even if passion does not develop, at least we will have the chance to build a friendship.",

    "essay0": "\"anyone plain can be lovely,\" - barenaked ladies  i'm a reserved, shy, intelligent, patient, dependable guy who's had zero luck in the women department. i've been told that i have good sense of humor. i'm also terrible at small talking, and nervous enough that i usually don't try to initiate conversations with women i meet (though this is small problem - i swear i won't be a mute in the first date).  i'm also honest, perhaps too much so. people tell me not to say in profiles like how good i am at dating, but i feel as though honesty is the best policy - if anyone reading this is \"turned off\" by knowing that, i probably don't want to be with them anyway.  i've moved out to california about 4 years ago for a job, right out of college. i love my work as a computer programmer. it's the best.  in my spare time, i play video game online with friends while skyping, occasionally watch some new anime, and i thoroughly enjoy watching pop-sci and pop-philosophy videos on youtube. i also pursue occasional programming projects on the side (i'm off to \"invent\" a better build system), i play dnd, and i follow politics somewhat. i would say that it makes me sad/annoyed/angry, but i suppose i'm already too jaded to have such an emotional response. i still care; getting sad/annoyed/angry doesn't help though.  do note that i strongly dislike bars, standard college parties aka \"frat parties\", or any party where one would see \"beer pong\" being played. i just feel way too uncomfortable in such places, and i seem to have nothing to talk about with such people as they're getting drunk.  also a big fan of lftr. energyfromthorium.com",

    "essay2": "i'm really good at analyzing arguments and understanding both sides. i was the president of my high school's debate team. this extends to being good at listening to somehow and understanding what they're trying to get at. i find myself frequently in meetings at work where sometimes culture and language barriers prevent an idea from getting across, and i instantly see both what is trying to be said, and specifically what's blocking the understanding. (i didn't follow up on debate in college because policy debate is not about finding truth; it's about winning. i felt as though i didn't gain anything by it.)  i have a knack at being good at video games. i'm not the best, but i tend to be better than almost everyone i know at almost all video games, fps, rts, fighting games, and so on.  i'm really good at all things computer related, really, especially programming. it is my vocation, after all.  i'm really good at coursework in school. my favorite anecdote on this subject was one time in college, in my friend's dorm room which barely fit the 6 people inside, this one woman, whom i've never seen before, said my friend said i took calc 3 the previous year, and she asked if she could copy my notes. i replied with as straight of a face as i could and said \"i'm sorry. i don't know where i put them. i might have thrown them out.\" somehow she saw right through me and stated/asked \"you're so smart you don't need to take notes, do you?\".  so, i'm really bad at lying, apparently.",
