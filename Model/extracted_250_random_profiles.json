(i work in a bar) i'm german, so i can be very blunt. some people think it's funny. some insist it's not. german sense of humor ... what can i say. some just don't get it :) a good laugh every day is good. it like a guy who can make me crack up at moments notice.  i know tons of people, but i only have a few really good friends because it's hard to come across people who will have your back 100%. so it's important to stick with the ones who do, and return the favor. i treat my friends with loyalty and respect, and expect the same in return. pet peeve: flakes! if you're a flake, chances are we can't hang.  finally: food. i eat healthy, but there isn't really anything i don't like, and really nothing i wouldn't eat. if i had to choose a favorite i would have to go with sushi ! i'm not willing to live without it   i'm also a big animal person. i love all animals (except for spiders ... i don't love spiders). i think animals are amazing and should rule the world. if it was up to me, i'd have a zoo, but due to spacial restrictions, i have a cat. name's cupid! and a baby rat: zsa zsa!",

    "essay0": "ich habe zwei jahre in wien gewohnt, und dadurch habe ich viel verbessert, deutsch zu sprechen. (ich glaube, ich habe das nicht richtig geschrieben.) ich gearbeitete an einem englischsprachigen forschungsinstitut, also, ich habe den vokabeln meistens in der bckerei und im lebensmittelgeschft gelernt! ich habe aber doch auch andere wrter (und vielleicht auch ein bisschen italienischen akzent) erhalten, von meiner derzeitigen itialienischen freundin. deutsch war die einzige sprache, dass wir zusammen sprechen knnten, und ich habe von ihr viel gelernt. sie war die einfachste person in ganz wien zu verstehen!  jetzt bin ich seit frh 2006 in die u.s. zurck, und leider habe ich keine gelegenheit gehabt, um zu praktizieren, und ich habe viel vergessen. ich htte gern neue freunde/freundinnen, damit regelmig deutsch zu sprechen. auch besser, wenn dein englisch so schlecht ist, wie mein deutsch!  ***** update: changes to \"looking for\". i originally checked off only long-term and short-term dating, as that's what brought me here and what i'm most interested in finding. but after a year on this site (my sole experience with dating sites), i find that i feel much too awkward and inhibited in this situation. the whole on-line method of meeting people just feels so artificial. and when i look at profiles, exchange first messages, and even when i meet somebody in person, i find myself to be overly cautious and critical, and at the same time overly self-conscious. i think it will help me relax if i can make this more like the way we meet new people in \"real life\"  no preconceptions about why i'm meeting somebody. take more of a \"friends first\" attitude, spend time with people i like, and try not to even think about dating somebody unless that spark occurs in person. so, i've now checked off \"new friends\" and \"activity partners\" in addition to dating. let's get together if it seems like we would like each other and enjoy each other's company. besides, my ideal lover is also a good friend! *****  hmm, this is always tough. i usually write very well, and easily. but having to write about myself kind of makes me freeze up. let's see, maybe this could be a way to get the juices flowing...  things that i've left out of my profile \"skinny\" (the itemized facts displayed to the right on each profile):  religion. why? because, like so many of the match questions, the available choices here are too simplistic to encompass my answers. basically, atheism, but that only scratches the surface. oh, pacifism too; not quite a religion but certainly a moral belief system. i'm jewish, but i don't follow the religion. i don't believe in god, or follow the traditions. but i nonetheless identify with the history, the heritage, the people; and to answer this question any other way but \"jewish\" would be to not stand up and be counted. to not be counted as a jew would almost be like hiding it, a kind of betrayal to my people in a still antisemitic world. and to not be counted as, specifically, a left-wing jew, would be to silently acquiesce to the dominance of the right, particularly in israel. (okay, i'm going to suppress my rant. this is, after all, a dating site. but if you like to talk politics or peace activism, we'll have plenty to talk about.)  and then there's buddhism. i don't practice it, but i've been influenced by some of its ideas, through my study of aikido. i think there's a lot to learn there. and there are aspects of hinduism that are very interesting, too. i find the idea of a single soul living many sequential lives, with lessons to be learned along the way, to be beautiful and powerful. and even if i don't believe in reincarnation per se (less absurd than the idea of a personified god or gods, but still not to be counted on), it is still a beautiful metaphor for our progress through this life.  my \"sign\": you know what, if you need to know my sign of the zodiac in order to come to some opinion about me or to be compatible with me  then you aren't! i refuse to believe this is a useful detail.  languages: (not actually something i left out, but at times in the past, the page failed to display it. anyway, i'd like to expand on that...) i love language (in general) and languages. i recently spent two years living in vienna, austria, and got pretty good with my german. i used to be very good at both spanish and french, but i haven't used them in years so a lot has slipped away. i could awkwardly and slowly make myself understood in spanish; not in french i don't think, though for some reason i still read it pretty well. i even studied a bit of yiddish. i would love to learn a new language (it could be my hobby if i only had a good opportunity to really use it) or get back up to speed in one of my old ones. in a long-term relationship with you, it would be a blast to learn to speak your language (or sign it, in the case of asl), and what a great excuse that would be to make time for language study. i would love to learn arabic, because my 2- and 5-year-old nieces are being raised trilingual (english, spanish, arabic). the 5-year-old, although she never speaks more than a word of it here and there, and she answers her arabic-speaking dad in english, clearly understands it. she taught me, when she was only 4, how to scold somebody in arabic, as an adult would scold a child, complete with hand gesture!  hey, if you hang out with me, be prepared for the occasional pun (i do love to laugh, even if this profile makes me sound very serious) and lots of etymology trivia.  i am honest, introspective, and inquisitive",

(update, i did the bicycling in a big way all summer, putting over 1600 miles on my bike. had great fun, and i felt, and looked, more fit than i've been in ages. saw beautiful sights in my own backyard that i never knew existed. it was the silver lining of unemployment. now once again, overwork has stalled me. balance is a work in progress.) getting caught up on the two years of star trek that i missed while i was in europe.

    "essay0": "i'm an expressive, love-seeking guy. i am a dreamer, usually an optimist, and love to laugh. i'm an engineer by profession and i like to watch cars go through the carwash and such. i have a strong predilection toward music, love going to live shows, have been getting back into playing the guitar and bass, and always have a song stuck in my head. being outdoors and feeling the sun on my body makes me happy. visiting wonderous outdoor places rejuvenates my soul. i also fancy foreign travel. getting enmeshed in unfamiliar exotic cultures is such a delicious mind-messer!  an east coast native, i impulsively moved to the bay area in 1992 after a friend persuaded me to come out and sleep on his couch. i quit my job, packed my car with essentials (mountain bike, clothing, skis, hiking boots, a pile of books and cds) and drove out. [the 2 month journey across the continent was one of the best times of my life, and one day may have to be replicated!] i fell in love with n. california immediately and never looked back.  one key thing i love about the bay area is the live-and-let-live ethic. living in the mission and meeting people outside of my east coast 'box' has enriched me. i'm so glad and lucky to be in a diverse city like this, and feel happy to be raising my son here. things i like to do: make lists, find an interesting hike nearby, play at the beach, jump around the house to some killer beats, attend an off-the-wall small theater production, eat at my favorite taco truck (yum!), try another eatery on valencia st., pull weeds out of the ground by the roots, do a weekend, midday show at the symphony, bike up bernal hill, eat an apple waiting for the music to start at the fillmore.  some other random things about me that i know about myself, or people have told me:  * i don't resemble a typical new yorker * i can drive all day just to be somewhere for a few hours because, life is short! * i have a book describing the highest peak in every california county and would one day love to summit them all :-) * i love reading maps * i can be a bit sarcastic * i like to yell at the tv when i hear disingenuous or inaccurate statements uttered by republicans * jon steward and steven colbert * i like gardening * i'm genuine and don't bother pretending to be someone i'm not * despite the fact that i like to be busy, a cuddly, cozy night at home is sometimes just what i need  i have been told by a very nice gal i met on this site that i should be more honest about my status. so here goes: i am not yet divorced, separated over a year. the divorce part hasn't happened yet because my ex needs health insurance until she finds a job that will provide it (she is actively looking). i feel like i have an interest in keeping the mother of my kid as healthy as possible.  also, the truth is that i probably still need to finish the healing process from the split-up, that i am a little uncertain about what i currently want. so, i don't think my heart is fully open to being an s.o. for someone right now. since i'm kind of love-oriented, that goes against my general tendencies. but i'm ok with it, and think it's the most realistic path for now. then suddenly, one day, unexpectedly, it won't be true anymore :-).  i have a 10 year old son who i am very close to and he lives with me 50% of the time. we tend to have a blast together. i strive to think of new ways to do fun things and expand his horizons. i also want to show him by example how to give back to the world, how truly lucky we are at this moment, to be living this life. some of this is still a work in progress.",

(for anyone who has read both of these, there is a quote that sums them up, for me anyway, \"orwell's '1984' shows a society controlled by the things we fear, huxley's 'brave new world' shows a society controlled by the things we love\")",
